Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nUse Cases\n\nAsynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition \nJSON Binding Rules \nScheme Rules  \n\nData Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices  \nSignature  \nEncryption  \n\nGlossary\nThis document provides the glossary for the Open API (Application Programming Interface) for FSP (Financial Service Provider) Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\"). Terms have been compiled from three sources:\n\nITU-T Digital Financial Services Focus Group Glossary (ITU-T),\nFeedback from Technology Service Providers (TSPs) in the PDP work groups (PDP) and\nFeedback from the L1P IST Reference Implementation team (RI).\n\nInformation is shared in accordance with Creative Commons Licensing.\nLogical Data Model\nThis document introduces the four generic transaction patterns that are supported in a logical version of the API. Additionally, all logical services that are part of the API are presented on a high-level.\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nThis document specifies the logical data model used by the API. Section 2 in the document lists elements used by each service. Section 3 in the document describes the data model in terms of basic elements, simple data types and complex data types.\nUse Cases\nThe purpose of this document is to define a set of use cases that can be implemented using the API. The use cases referenced within this document provide an overview of transaction processing flows and business rules of each transaction step as well as relevant error conditions. The primary purpose of the API is to support the movement of financial transactions between one Financial Services Provider (FSP) and another.\nIt should be noted that the API is only responsible for message exchange between FSPs and a Switch when a cross-FSP transaction is initiated by an End User in one of the FSPs. This can occur in either of two scenarios: \n\nA bilateral scenario in which FSPs communicate with each other\nA Switch based scenario in which all communication goes through a Switch \n\nReconciliation, clearing and settlement after real time transactions is out of scope for the API. Additionally, account lookup is supported by the API, but it relies on the implementation in a local market in which a third party or Switch would provide such services. Therefore, the need for effective on-boarding processes and appropriate scheme rules must be considered when implementing use cases.\nAPI Definition\nThe API Definition document introduces and describes the API. The purpose of the API is to enable interoperable financial transactions between a Payer (a payer of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in one FSP (an entity that provides a digital financial service to an end user) and a Payee (a recipient of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in another FSP. The API does not specify any front-end services between a Payer or Payee and its own FSP; all services defined in the API are between FSPs. FSPs are connected either (a) directly to each other or (b) by a Switch placed between the FSPs to route financial transactions to the correct FSP. \nThe transfer of funds from a Payer to a Payee should be performed in near real-time. As soon as a financial transaction has been agreed to by both parties, it is deemed irrevocable. This means that a completed transaction cannot be reversed in the API. To reverse a transaction, a new negated refund transaction should be created from the Payee of the original transaction.  \nThe API is designed to be sufficiently generic to support both a wide number of use cases and extensibility of those use cases, However, it should contain sufficient detail to enable implementation in an unambiguous fashion.Version 1.0 of the API is designed to be used within a country or region; international remittance that requires foreign exchange is not supported. This version also contains basic support for the Interledger Protocol, which will in future versions of the API be used for supporting foreign exchange and multi-hop financial transactions.\nThis document:\n\nDefines an asynchronous REST binding of the logical API introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nAdds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification.

These business rules should be governed by FSPs and an optional regulatory authority implementing the API within a scheme.b.    The regulatory authority or implementing authority should identify valid values for these business scheme rules in their API policy document.   \nAPI implementation Scheme Rules:a.    These API parameters should be agreed on by FSPs and the optional Switch. These parameters should be part of the implementation policy of a scheme.b.    All participants should configure these API parameters as indicated by the API-level scheme rules for the implementation with which they are working.   \nSecurity and Non-Functional Scheme Rules.a.    Security and non-functional scheme rules should be determined and identified in the implementation policy of a scheme.   \n\nJSON Binding Rules\nThe purpose of this document is to express the data model used by the API in the form of JSON Schema binding rules, along with validation rules for the corresponding instances.\nThis document adds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification. The contents of the Specification are listed in Section 1.1.\nThe types used in the PDP API fall primarily into three categories:\n\nBasic data types and Formats used\nElement types\nComplex types\n\nThe various types used in API Definition, Data Model and the Open API Specification, as well as the JSON transformation rules to which their instances must adhere, are identified in the following sections.\nScheme Rules\nThis document defines scheme rules for Open API for FSP Interoperability (hereafter cited as the API) in three categories.\n\nBusiness Scheme Rules:a.    These business rules should be governed by FSPs and an optional regulatory authority implementing the API within a scheme.b.    The regulatory authority or implementing authority should identify valid values for these business scheme rules in their API policy document.   \nAPI implementation Scheme Rules:a.    These API parameters should be agreed on by FSPs and the optional Switch. These parameters should be part of the implementation policy of a scheme.b.    All participants should configure these API parameters as indicated by the API-level scheme rules for the implementation with which they are working.   \nSecurity and Non-Functional Scheme Rules.a.    Security and non-functional scheme rules should be determined and identified in the implementation policy of a scheme.   \n\nPKI Best Practices\nThis document explains Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)  best practices to apply in the API deployment. See Chapter 2, PKI Background, for more information about PKI. \nThe API should be implemented in an environment that consists of either:\n\nFinancial Service Providers (FSPs) that communicate with other FSPs (in a bilateral setup) or \nA Switch that acts as an intermediary platform between FSP platforms. There is also an Account Lookup System (ALS) available to identify in which FSP an account holder is located.\n\nFor more information about the environment, see Chapter 3, Network Topology. Chapters 4 and 5 identify management strategies for the CA and for the platform. Communication between platforms is performed using a REST (REpresentational State Transfer)-based HTTP protocol (for more information, see API Definition). Because this protocol does not provide a means for ensuring either integrity or confidentiality between platforms, extra security layers must be added to protect sensitive information from alteration or exposure to unauthorized parties.\nSignature\nThis document details security methods to be implemented for the API to ensure confidentiality of API messages between an API client and the API server.\nIn information security, confidentiality means that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes (Excerpt ISO27000 ). For the API, confidentiality means that some sensitive fields in the payload of an API message cannot be accessed or identified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by the intermediaries involved in the API communication. That is, if some fields of an API message are encrypted by the API client, then only the expected API recipient can decrypt those fields.\nJSON Web Encryption (JWE RFC7516 )must be applied to the API to provide message confidentiality. When an API client sends an HTTP request (such as an API request or callback message) to a counterparty, the API client can determine whether there are sensitive fields in the API message to be protected according to the regulation or local schema. If there is a field to be protected, then the API client uses JWE to encrypt the value of that field. Subsequently, the cipher text of that field will be transmitted to the counterparty.\nTo support encryption for multiple fields of an API message, JWE is extended in this document to adapt to the requirements of the API.\nEncryption\nThis document details the security methods to be implemented for the API to ensure integrity and non-repudiation between the API client and the API server.\nIn information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. For the API, data integrity means that an API message cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by parties involved in the API communication.\nIn legal terms, non-repudiation means that a person intends to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also means that one party in a transaction cannot deny having received the transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent the transaction. For the API, non-repudiation means that an API client cannot deny having sent an API message to a counterparty. JSON Web Signature (JWS), as defined in RFC 7515 , must be applied to the API to provide message integrity and non-repudiation for either component fields of an API payload or the full API payload. Whenever an API client sends an API message to a counterparty, the API client should sign the message using its private key. After the counterparty receives the API message, the counterparty must validate the signature with the API clientâ€™s public key. Only the HTTP request message of an API message need to be signed, any HTTP response message of the APIs SHALL NOT be signed.   \nNote:\n\nThe corresponding public key should either be shared in advance with the counterparty or retrieved by the counterparty (for example, the local scheme Certificate Authority).\n\nBecause intermediary fees are not supported in the current version of the API, intermediaries involved in API message-transit may not modify the API message payload. Thus, the signature at full payload level is used to protect the integrity of the full payload of an API message from end-to-end. Regardless of how many intermediaries there are in transit, the original payload cannot be modified by the intermediaries. The final recipient of the API message must validate the signature generated by the original API client based on the message payload received.\nNotes:\n\nWhether the signature needs to be validated by the intermediaries in transit is determined by the internal implementation of each intermediary or the local schema.\nIn a future version of the API, intermediary fees may be supported; at that time, signature-at-field-level may also be supported. However, both features are out-of-scope for the current version (1.0) of the API.\n\n"},"documents/API Definition v1.0.html":{"url":"documents/API Definition v1.0.html","title":"API Definition v1.0","keywords":"","body":"1.

Introduction\nThis document introduces and describes the Open API (Application Programming Interface) for FSP (Financial Service Provider) Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\"). The purpose of the API is to enable interoperable financial transactions between a Payer (a payer of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in one FSP (an entity that provides a digital financial service to an end user) and a Payee (a recipient of electronic funds in a payment transaction) located in another FSP. The API does not specify any front-end services between a Payer or Payee and its own FSP; all services defined in the API are between FSPs. FSPs are connected either (a) directly to each other or (b) by a Switch placed between the FSPs to route financial transactions to the correct FSP.\nThe transfer of funds from a Payer to a Payee should be performed in near real-time. As soon as a financial transaction has been agreed to by both parties, it is deemed irrevocable. This means that a completed transaction cannot be reversed in the API. To reverse a transaction, a new negated refund transaction should be created from the Payee of the original transaction.\nThe API is designed to be sufficiently generic to support both a wide number of use cases and extensibility of those use cases, However, it should contain sufficient detail to enable implementation in an unambiguous fashion.\nVersion 1.0 of the API is designed to be used within a country or region, international remittance that requires foreign exchange is not supported. This version also contains basic support for the Interledger Protocol, which will in future versions of the API be used for supporting foreign exchange and multi-hop financial transactions.\nThis document:\n\nDefines an asynchronous REST binding of the logical API introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nAdds to and builds on the information provided in Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification. The contents of the Specification are listed in Section 2.1.\n\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\nUse Cases\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\nJSON Binding Rules\nScheme Rules\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\nSignature\nEncryption\n\n3. API Definition\nThis section introduces the technology used by the API, including:\n\nGeneral Characteristics\nHTTP Details\nAPI Versioning\n\n3.1 General Characteristics\nThis section describes the general characteristics of the API.\n3.1.1 Architectural Style\nThe API is based on the REST (REpresentational State Transfer1) architectural style. There are, however, some differences between a typical REST implementation and this one. These differences include:\n\nFully asynchronous API -- To be able to handle numerous concurrent long-running processes and to have a single mechanism for handling requests, all API services are asynchronous. Examples of long-running processes are:\n\nFinancial transactions done in bulk\nA financial transaction in which user interaction is needed\n\n\nDecentralized -- Services are decentralized, there is no central authority which drives a transaction.\n\nService-oriented -- The resources provided by the API are relatively service-oriented compared to a typical implementation of a REST-based API.\n\nNot fully stateless -- Some state information must be kept in both client and server during the process of performing a financial transaction.\n\nClient decides common ID -- In a typical REST implementation, in which there is a clear distinction between client and server, it is the server that generates the ID of an object when the object is created on the server. In this API, a quote or a financial transaction resides both in the Payer and Payee FSP as the services are decentralized. Therefore, there is a need for a common ID of the object. The reason for having the client decide the common ID is two-fold:\n\nThe common ID is used in the URI of the asynchronous callback to the client. The client therefore knows which URI to listen to for a callback regarding the request.\nThe client can use the common ID in an HTTP GET request directly if it does not receive a callback from the server (see Section 3.2.2 for more information).\n\nTo keep the common IDs unique, each common ID is defined as a UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier2 (UUID). To further guarantee uniqueness, it is recommended that a server should separate each client FSP's IDs by mapping the FSP ID and the object ID together. If a server still receives a non-unique common ID during an HTTP POST request (see Section 3.2.2 for more details). The request should be handled as detailed in Section 3.2.5.\n\n\n3.1.2 Application-Level Protocol\nHTTP, as defined in RFC 72303, is used as the application-level protocol in the API. All communication in production environments should be secured using HTTPS (HTTP over TLS4). For more details about the use of HTTP in the API, see Section 3.2.\n3.1.3 URI Syntax\nThe syntax of URIs follows RFC 39865 to identify resources and services provided by the API. This section introduces and notes implementation subjects specific to each syntax part.\nA generic URI has the form shown in Listing 1, where the part [user:password@]host[:port] is the Authority part described in Section 3.1.3.2\n{resource}.\nListing 1\nscheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment]\n\nListing 1 -- Generic URI format\n3.1.3.1 Scheme\nIn accordance with Section 3.1.2, the scheme (that is, the set of rules, practices and standards necessary for the functioning of payment services) will always be either http or https.\n3.1.3.2 Authority\nThe authority part consists of an optional authentication (User Information) part, a mandatory host part, followed by an optional port number.\n3.1.3.2.1 User Information\nUser information should in general not be used by API deployments; the security measures detailed in API Signature and API Encryption should be used instead.\n3.1.3.2.2 Host\nThe host is the server's address. It can be either an IP address or a hostname. The host will (usually) differ for each deployment.\n3.1.3.2.3 Port\nThe port number is optional; by default, the HTTP port is 80 and HTTPS is 443, but other ports could also be used. Which port to use might differ from deployment to deployment.\n3.1.3.3 Path\nThe path points to an actual API resource or service. The resources in the API are:\n\nparticipants\nparties\nquotes\ntransactionRequests\nauthorizations\ntransfers\ntransactions\nbulkQuotes\nbulkTransfers\n\nAll resources found above are also organized further in a hierarchical form, separated by one or more forward slashes ('/'). Resources support different services depending on the HTTP method used. All supported API resources and services, tabulated with URI and HTTP method, appear in Table 5.\n3.1.3.4 Query\nThe query is an optional part of a URI; it is currently only used and supported by a few services in the API. See the API resources in Section 6, API Services, for more details about which services support query strings. All other services should ignore the query string part of the URI, as query strings may be added in future minor versions of the API (see Section 3.3.2).\nIf more than one key-value pair is used in the query string, the pairs should be separated by an ampersand symbol ('&').\nListing 2 shows a URI example from the API resource /authorization, in which four different key-value pairs are present in the query string, separated by an ampersand symbol.\nListing 2\n/authorization/3d492671-b7af-4f3f-88de-76169b1bdf88?authenticationType=OTP&retriesLeft=2&amount=102&currency=USD\n\nListing 2 -- Example URI containing several key-value pairs in the query string\n3.1.3.5 Fragment\nThe fragment is an optional part of a URI. It is not supported for use by any service in the API and therefore should be ignored if received.\n3.1.4 URI Normalization and Comparison\nAs specified in RFC 72306, the scheme (Section 3.1.3.1) and host (Section 3.1.3.2.2) part of the URI should be considered case-insensitive. All other parts of the URI should be processed in a case-sensitive manner.\n3.1.5 Character Set\nThe character set should always be assumed to be UTF-8, defined in 36297; therefore, it does not need to be sent in any of the HTTP header fields (see Section 3.2.1). No character set other than UTF-8 is supported by the API.\n3.1.6 Data Exchange Format\nThe API uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), defined in RFC 71598, as its data exchange format. JSON is an open, lightweight, human-readable and platform-independent format, well-suited for interchanging data between systems.\n3.2 HTTP Details\nThis section contains detailed information regarding the use of the application-level protocol HTTP in the API.\n3.2.1 HTTP Header Fields\nHTTP Headers are generally described in RFC 72309. The following two sections describes the HTTP header fields that should be expected and implemented in the API.\nThe API supports a maximum size of 65536 bytes (64 Kilobytes) in the HTTP header.\n3.2.1.1 HTTP Request Header Fields\nTable 1 contains the HTTP request header fields that must be supported by implementers of the API. An implementation should also expect other standard and non-standard HTTP request header fields not listed here.\nTable 1\n\n\n\nField\nExample Values\nCardinality\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAccept\napplication/vnd.interoperability.resource+json\n0..1Mandatory in a request from a client. Not used in a callback from the server.The Accept10 header field indicates the version of the API the client would like the server to use. See HTTP Accept Header Section 3.3.4.1 for more information on requesting a specific version of the API.\n\n\nContent-Length\n3495\n0..1\nThe Content-Type11 header field indicates the anticipated size of the payload body. Only sent if there is a body.>Note: The API supports a maximum size of 5242880 bytes (5 Megabytes).\n\n\nContent-Type\napplication/vnd.interoperability.resource+json;version=1.0\n1\nThe Content-Type12 header indicates the specific version of the API used to send the payload body. See Section 3.3.4.2 for more information.\n\n\nDate\nTue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT\n1\nThe Date13 header field indicates the date when the request was sent.\n\n\nX- Forwarded- For\nX-Forwarded-For: 192.168.0.4, 136.225.27.13\n1..0\nThe X-Forwarded-For14 header field is an unofficially accepted standard used to indicate the originating client IP address for informational purposes, as a request might pass multiple proxies, firewalls, and so on. Multiple X-Forwarded-For values as in the example shown here should be expected and supported by implementers of the API.Note: An alternative to X-Forwarded-For is defined in RFC 723915. However, as of 2018, RFC 7239 is less-used and supported than X-Forwarded-For.\n\n\nFSPIOP- Source\nFSP321\n1\nThe FSPIOP-Source header field is a non- HTTP standard field used by the API for identifying the sender of the HTTP request. The field should be set by the original sender of the request. Required for routing (see Section 3.2.3.5) and signature verification (see header field FSPIOP-Signature).\n\n\nFSPIOP- Destination\nFSP123\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-Destination header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for HTTP header-based routing of requests and responses to the destination. The field should be set by the original sender of the request (if known), so that any entities between the client and the server do not need to parse the payload for routing purposes (see Section 3.2.3.5).\n\n\nFSPIOP- Encryption\n\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-Encryption header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for applying end-to-end encryption of the request.For more information, see API Encryption.\n\n\nFSPIOP- Signature\n\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-Signature header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for applying an end-to-end request signature.For more information, see API Signature.\n\n\nFSPIOP-URI\n/parties/msisdn/123456789\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-URI header field is a non- HTTP standard field used by the API for signature verification, should contain the service URI. Required if signature verification is used, for more information see API Signature.\n\n\nFSPIOP- HTTP- Method\nGET\n0..1\nThe FSPIOP-HTTP-Method header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by the API for signature verification, should contain the service HTTP method. Required if signature verification is used, for more information see API Signature.\n\n\n\nTable 1 -- HTTP request header fields\n3.2.1.2 HTTP Response Header Fields\nTable 2 contains the HTTP response header fields that must be supported by implementers of the API. An implementation should also expect other standard and non-standard HTTP response header fields that are not listed here.\nTable 2\n\n\n\nField\nExample Values\nCardinality\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nContent-Lenght\n3495\n0..1\nThe Content-Length16 header field indicates the anticipated size of the payload body. Only sent if there is a body.\n\n\nContent-Type\napplication/vnd.interoperability.resource+json;version=1.0\n1\nThe Content-Type17 header field indicates the specific version of the API used to send the payload body. See Section 3.3.4.2 for more information.\n\n\n\nTable 2 -- HTTP response header fields\n3.2.2 HTTP Methods\nThe following HTTP methods, as defined in RFC 723118, are supported by the API:\n\nGET -- The HTTP GET method is used from a client to request information about a previously-created object on a server. As all services in the API are asynchronous, the response to the GET method will not contain the requested object. The requested object will instead come as part of a callback using the HTTP PUT method.\n\nPUT -- The HTTP PUT method is used as a callback to a previously sent HTTP GET, HTTP POST or HTTP DELETE method, sent from a server to its client. The callback will contain either:\n\nObject information concerning a previously created object (HTTP POST) or sent information request (HTTP GET).\nAcknowledgement that whether an object was deleted (HTTP DELETE).\nError information in case the HTTP POST or HTTP GET request failed to be processed on the server.\n\n\nPOST -- The HTTP POST method is used from a client to request an object to be created on the server. As all services in the API are asynchronous, the response to the POST method will not contain the created object. The created object will instead come as part of a callback using the HTTP PUT method.\n\nDELETE -- The HTTP DELETE method is used from a client to request an object to be deleted on the server. The HTTP DELETE method should only be supported in a common Account Lookup System (ALS) for deleting information regarding a previously added Party (an account holder in a FSP), no other object types can be deleted. As all services in the API are asynchronous, the response to the HTTP DELETE method will not contain the final acknowledgement that the object was deleted or not; the final acknowledgement will come as a callback using the HTTP PUT method.\n\n\n3.2.3 HTTP Sequence Flow\nAll the sequences and related services use an asynchronous call flow. No service supports a synchronous call flow.\n3.2.3.1 HTTP POST Call Flow\nFigure 1 shows the normal API call flow for a request to create an object in a Peer FSP using HTTP POST. The service /service in the flow should be renamed to any of the services in Table 5 that support the HTTP POST method.\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1 -- HTTP POST call flow\n3.2.3.2 HTTP GET Call Flow\nFigure 2 shows the normal API call flow for a request to get information about an object in a Peer FSP using HTTP GET. The service /service/{ID} in the flow should be renamed to any of the services in Table 5 that supports the HTTP GET method.\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2 -- HTTP GET call flow\n3.2.3.3 HTTP DELETE Call Flow\nFigure 3 contains the normal API call flow to delete FSP information about a Party in an ALS using HTTP DELETE. The service /service/{ID} in the flow should be renamed to any of the services in Table 5 that supports the HTTP DELETE method. HTTP DELETE is only supported in a common ALS, which is why the figure shows the ALS entity as a server only.\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3 -- HTTP DELETE call flow\nNote: It is also possible that requests to the ALS be routed through a Switch, or that the ALS and the Switch are the same server.\n3.2.3.4 HTTP PUT Call Flow\nThe HTTP PUT is always used as a callback to either a POST service request, a GET service request, or a DELETE service request.\nThe call flow of a PUT request and response can be seen in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3.\n3.2.3.5 Call Flow Routing using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source\nThe non-standard HTTP header fields FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are used for routing and message signature verification purposes (see API Signature for more information regarding signature verification). Figure 4 shows how the header fields are used for routing in an abstract POST /service call flow, where the destination (Peer) FSP is known.\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4 -- Using the customized HTTP header fields FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source\nFor some services when a Switch is used, the destination FSP might be unknown. An example of this scenario is when an FSP sends a GET /parties to the Switch without knowing which Peer FSP that owns the Party (see Section 6.3.1 describing the scenario). FSPIOP-Destination will in that case be empty (or set to the Switch's ID) from the FSP, but will subsequently be set by the Switch to the correct Peer FSP. See Figure 5 for an example describing the usage of FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source.\nFigure 5\n\nFigure 5 -- Example scenario where FSPIOP-Destination is unknown by FSP\n3.2.4 HTTP Response Status Codes\nThe API supports the HTTP response status codes19 in Table 3.\nTable 3\n\n\n\nStatus Code\nReason\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n200\nOK\nStandard response for a successful request. Used in the API by the client as a response on a callback to mark the completion of an asynchronous service.\n\n\n202\nAccepted\nThe request has been accepted for future processing at the server, but the server cannot guarantee that the outcome of the request will be successful. Used in the API to acknowledge that the server has received an asynchronous request.\n\n\n400\nBad Request\nThe application cannot process the request; for example, due to malformed syntax or the payload exceeded size restrictions.\n\n\n401\nUnauthorized\nThe request requires authentication in order to be processed.\n\n\n403\nForbidden\nThe request was denied and will be denied in the future.\n\n\n404\nNot Found\nThe resource specified in the URI was not found.\n\n\n405\nMethod Not Allowed\nAn unsupported HTTP method for the request was used; see Table 5 for information on which HTTP methods are allowed in which services.\n\n\n406\nNot acceptable\nThe server is not capable of generating content according to the Accept headers sent in the request. Used in the API to indicate that the server does not support the version that the client is requesting.\n\n\n501\nNot Implemented\nThe server does not support the requested service. The client should not retry.\n\n\n503\nService Unavailable\nThe server is currently unavailable to accept any new service requests. This should be a temporary state, and the client should retry within a reasonable time frame.\n\n\n\n Table 3 -- HTTP response status codes supported in the API\nAny HTTP status codes 3xx20 returned by the server should not be retried and require manual investigation.\nAn implementation of the API should also be capable of handling other errors not defined above as the request could potentially be routed through proxy servers.\nAs all requests in the API are asynchronous, additional HTTP error codes for server errors (error codes starting with 5xx21 that are not defined in Table 3) are not used by the API itself. Any error on the server during actual processing of a request will be sent as part of an error callback to the client (see Section 9.2).\n3.2.4.1 Error Information in HTTP Response\nIn addition to the HTTP response code, all HTTP error responses (4xx and 5xx status codes) can optionally contain an ErrorInformation element, defined in Section 7.4.2 This element should be used to give more detailed information to the client if possible.\n3.2.5 Idempotent Services in Server\nAll services that support HTTP GET must be idempotent; that is, the same request can be sent from a client any number of times without changing the object on the server. The server is allowed to change the state of the object; for example, a transaction state can be changed, but the FSP sending the GET request cannot change the state.\nAll services that support HTTP POST must be idempotent in case the client is sending the same service ID again; that is, the server must not create a new service object if a client sends the same POST request again. The reason behind this is to simplify the handling of resends during error-handling in a client; however, this creates some extra requirements of the server that receives the request. An example in which the same POST request is sent several times can be seen in Section 9.4.\n3.2.5.1 Duplicate Analysis in Server on Receiving a HTTP POST Request\nWhen a server receives a request from a client, the server should check to determine if there is an already-existing service object with the same ID; for example, if a client has previously sent the request POST /transfers with the identical transferId. If the object already exists, the server must check to determine if the parameters of the already-created object match the parameters from the new request.\n\nIf the previously-created object matches the parameter from the new request, the request should be assumed to be a resend from the client.\n\nIf the server has not finished processing the old request and therefore has not yet sent the callback to the client, this new request can be ignored, because a callback is about to be sent to the client.\nIf the server has finished processing the old request and a callback has already been sent, a new callback should be sent to the client, similar to if a HTTP GET request had been sent.\n\n\nIf the previously-created object does not match the parameters from the new request, an error callback should be sent to the client explaining that an object with the provided ID already exists with conflicting parameters.\n\n\nTo simplify duplicate analysis, it is recommended to create and store a hash value of all incoming POST requests on the server, so that it is easy to compare the hash value against later incoming POST requests.\n3.3 API Versioning\nThe strategy of the development of the API is to maintain backwards compatibility between the API and its resources and services to the maximum extent possible; however, changes to the API should be expected by implementing parties. Versioning of the API is specific to the API resource (for example, /participants, /quotes, /transfers).\nThere are two types of API resource versions: Minor versions, which are backwards-compatible, and major versions, which are backwards-incompatible.\n\nWhenever a change in this document defining the characteristics of the API is updated that in some way affects an API service, the affected resource will be updated to a new major or minor version (depending on whether the changes are backwards-compatible or not).\n\nWhenever a change is made to a specific service in the API, a new version of the corresponding resource will be released.\n\n\nThe format of the resource version is x.y where x is the major version and y is the minor version. Both major and minor versions are sequentially numbered. When a new major version of a service is released, the minor version is reset to 0. The initial version of each resource in the API is 1.0.\n3.3.1 Changes not Affecting the API Resource Version\nSome changes will not affect the API resource version; for example, if the order of parameters within a request or callback were to be changed.\n3.3.2 Minor API Resource Version\nThe following list describes the changes that are considered backwards compatible if the change affects any API service connected to a resource. API implementers should implement their client/server in such a way that the API services automatically support these changes without breaking any functionality.\n\nOptional input parameters such as query strings added in a request\nOptional parameters added in a request or a callback\nError codes added\n\nThese types of changes affect the minor API service version.\n3.3.3 Major API Resource Versions\nThe following list describes the changes that are considered backwards-incompatible if the change affects any API service connected to a resource. API implementers do not need to implement their client/server in such a way that it automatically supports these changes.\n\nMandatory parameters removed or added to a request or callback\nOptional parameters changed to mandatory in a request or callback\nParameters renamed\nData types changed\nBusiness logic of API resource or connected services changed\nAPI resource/service URIs changed\n\nThese types of changes affect the major API service version. Please note that the list is not comprehensive; there might be other changes as well that could affect the major API service version.\n3.3.4 Version Negotiation between Client and Server\nThe API supports basic version negotiation by using HTTP content negotiation between the server and the client. A client should send the API resource version that it would like to use in the Accept header to the server (see Section 3.3.4.1). If the server supports that version, it should use that version in the callback (see Section 3.3.4.2). If the server does not support the requested version, the server should reply with HTTP status 40622 including a list of supported versions (see Section 3.3.4.3).\n3.3.4.1 HTTP Accept Header\nSee below for an example of a simplified HTTP request which only includes an Accept header23. The Accept header should be used from a client requesting a service from a server specifying a major version of the API service. The example in Listing 3 should be interpreted as \"I would like to use major version 1 of the API resource, but if that version is not supported by the server then give me the latest supported version\".\nListing 3\nPOST /service HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.interoperability.{resource}+json;version=1,\napplication/vnd.interoperability.{resource}+json\n\n{\n    ...\n}\nListing 3 -- HTTP Accept header example, requesting version 1 or the latest supported version\nRegarding the example in Listing 3:\n\nThe POST /service should be changed to any HTTP method and related service or resource that is supported by the API (see Table 5).\nThe Accept header field is used to indicate the API resource version the client would like to use. If several versions are supported by the client, more than one version can be requested separated by a comma (,) as in the example above.\nThe application type is always application/vnd.interoperability.{resource}, where {resource} is the actual resource (for example, participants or quotes).\nThe only data exchange format currently supported is json.\nIf a client can use any minor version of a major version, only the major version should be sent; for example, version=1 or version=2.\nIf a client would like to use a specific minor version, this should be indicated by using the specific major.minor version; for example, version=1.2 or version=2.8. The use of a specific major.minor version in the request should generally be avoided, as minor versions should be backwards-compatible.\n\n\n\n3.3.4.2 Acceptable Version Requested by Client\nIf the server supports the API resource version requested by the client in the Accept Headers, it should use that version in the subsequent callback. The used major.minor version should always be indicated in the Content-Type header by the server, even if the client only requested a major version of the API. See the example in Listing 4, which indicates that version 1.0 is used by the server:\nListing 4\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.resource+json;version=1.0\nListing 4 -- Content-Type HTTP header field example\n3.3.4.3 Non-Acceptable Version Requested by Client\nIf the server does not support the version requested by the client in the Accept header, the server should reply with HTTP status 406, which indicates that the requested version is not supported.\nNote: There is also a possibility that the information might be sent as part of an error callback to a client instead of directly in the response; for example, when the request is routed through a Switch which does support the requested version, but the destination FSP does not support the requested version.\nAlong with HTTP status 406, the supported versions should be listed as part of the error message in the extensions list, using the major version number as key and minor version number as value. Please see error information in the example in Listing 5, describing the server's supported versions. The example should be interpreted as \"I do not support the resource version that you requested, but I do support versions 1.0, 2.1, and 4.2\".\nListing 5\n{\n    \"errorInformation\": {\n        \"errorCode\": \"3001\",\n        \"errorDescription\": \"The Client requested an unsupported version, see exten-\nsion list for supported version(s).\",\n        \"extensionList\": [\n            { \"key\": \"1\", \"value\": \"0\"},\n            { \"key\": \"2\", \"value\": \"1\"},\n            { \"key\": \"4\", \"value\": \"2\"},\n        ]\n    }\n}\n\nListing 5 -- Example error message when server does not support the requested version\n1  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm -- Representational State Transfer (REST)\n2  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122 -- A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace\n3  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing\n4  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246 -- The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol - Version 1.2\n5  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986 -- Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax\n6  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7.3 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing - http and https URI Normalization and Comparison\n7  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629 -- UTF-8, a transformation format of ISO 10646\n8  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159 -- The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format\n9  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing - Header Fields\n10  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Accept\n11  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing -- Content-Length\n12  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -- Content-Type\n13  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -- Date\n14  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For -- X-Forwarded-For\n15  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239 -- Forwarded HTTP Extension\n16  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing -- Content-Length\n17  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.1.5 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -- Content-Type\n18  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Request Methods\n19  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Response Status Codes\n20  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Redirection 3xx\n21  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.6 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Server Error 5xx\n22  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.6 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - 406 Not Acceptable\n23  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3.2 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content - Accept\n4. Interledger Protocol\nThe current version of the API includes basic support for the Interledger Protocol (ILP), by defining a concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request protocol24 in API Resource /quotes, Section 6.5, and API Resource /transfers, Section 6.7.\n4.1 More Information\nThis document contains ILP information that is relevant to the API. For more information about the ILP protocol, see the Interledger project website25, the Interledger Whitepaper26, and the Interledger architecture specification27.\n4.2 Introduction to Interledger\nILP is a standard for internetworking payment networks. In the same way that the Internet Protocol (IP) establishes a set of basic standards for the transmission and addressing of data packets between different data networks, ILP establishes a set of basic standards for the addressing of financial transactions and transfer of value between accounts on different payment networks.\nILP is not a scheme. It is a set of standards that, if implemented by multiple payment schemes, will allow those schemes to be interoperable. Therefore, implementing ILP involves adapting an existing scheme to conform to those standards. Conformance means ensuring that transfers between accounts within the scheme are done in two phases (reserve and commit) and defining a mapping between the accounts in the scheme and the global ILP Addressing scheme. This can be done by modifying the scheme itself, or by the entities that provide ILP-conformant access to the scheme using scheme adaptors.\nThe basic prerequisites for an ILP payment are the Payee ILP address(see Section 4.3) and the condition (see Section 4.4). In the current version of the API, both these prerequisites should be returned by the Payee FSP during quoting API Resource /quotes, see Section 6.5) of the financial transaction.\n4.3 ILP Addressing\nA key component of the ILP standard is the ILP addressing28 scheme. It is a hierarchical scheme that defines one or more addresses for every account on a ledger.\nTable 4 shows some examples of ILP addresses that could be used in different scenarios, for different accounts. Note that while the structure of addresses is standardized, the content is not, except for the first segment (up to the first period (.)).\nTable 4\n\n\n\nILP Address\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ng.tz.fsp1.msisdn.1234567890\nA mobile money account at FSP1 for the user with MSISDN 1234567890.\n\n\ng.pk.fsp2.ac03396c-4dba-4743\nA mobile money account at FSP2 identified by an opaque account id.\n\n\ng.us.bank1.bob\nA bank account at Bank1 for the user bob.\n\n\n\nTable 4 -- ILP address examples\nThe primary purpose of an ILP addresses is to identify an account in order to route a financial transaction to that account.\nNote: An ILP address should not be used for identifying a counterparty in the Interoperability API. See Section 5.1.6.11 regarding how to address a Party in the API.\nIt is useful to think of ILP addresses as analogous to IP addresses. They are seldom, if ever, be seen by end users but are used by the systems involved in a financial transaction to identify an account and route the ILP payment. The design of the addressing scheme means that a single account will often have many ILP addresses. The system on which the account is maintained may track these or, if they are all derived from a common prefix, may track a subset only.\n4.4 Conditional Transfers\nILP depends on the concept of conditional transfers, in which all ledgers involved in a financial transaction from the Payer to the Payee can first reserve funds out of a Payer account and then later commit them to the Payee account. The transfer from the Payer to the Payee account is conditional on the presentation of a fulfilment that satisfies the condition attached to the original transfer request.\nTo support conditional transfers for ILP, a ledger must support a transfer API that attaches a condition and an expiry to the transfer. The ledger must prepare the transfer by reserving the funds from the Payer account, and then wait for one of the following events to occur:\n\nThe fulfilment of the condition is submitted to the ledger and the funds are committed to the Payee account.\n\nThe expiry timeout is reached, or the financial transaction is rejected by the Payee or Payee FSP. The transfer is then aborted and the funds that were reserved from the Payer account are returned.\n\n\nWhen the fulfilment of a transfer is submitted to a ledger, the ledger must ensure that the fulfilment is valid for the condition that was attached to the original transfer request. If it is valid, the transfer is committed, otherwise it is rejected, and the transfer remains in a pending state until a valid fulfilment is submitted or the transfer expires.\nILP supports a variety of conditions for performing a conditional payment, but implementers of the API should use the SHA-256 hash of a 32-byte pre-image. The condition attached to the transfer is the SHA-256 hash and the fulfilment of that condition is the pre-image. Therefore, if the condition attached to a transfer is a SHA -256 hash, then when a fulfilment is submitted for that transaction, the ledger will validate it by calculating the SHA-256 hash of the fulfilment and ensuring that the hash is equal to the condition.\nSee Section 6.5.1.2 Interledger Payment Request for concrete information on how to generate the fulfilment and the condition.\n4.5 ILP Packet\nThe ILP Packet is the mechanism used to package end-to-end data that can be passed in a hop-by-hop service. It is included as a field in hop-by-hop service calls and should not be modified by any intermediaries. The integrity of the ILP Packet is tightly bound to the integrity of the funds transfer, as the commit trigger (the fulfilment) is generated using a hash of the ILP Packet.\nThe packet has a strictly defined binary format, because it may be passed through systems that are designed for high performance and volume. These intermediary systems must read the ILP Address and the amount from the packet headers, but do not need to interpret the data field in the ILP Packet (see Listing 6). Since the intermediary systems should not need to interpret the data field, the format of the field is not strictly defined in the ILP Packet definition. It is simply defined as a variable length octet string. Section 6.5.1.2 Interledger Payment Request contains concrete information on how the ILP Packet is populated in the API.\nThe ILP Packet is the common thread that connects all the individual ledger transfers that make up an end-to-end ILP payment. The packet is parsed by the Payee of the first transfer and used to determine where to make the next transfer, and for how much. It is attached to that transfer and parsed by the Payee of the next transfer, who again determines where to make the next transfer, and for how much. This process is repeated until the Payee of the transfer is the Payee in the end-to-end financial transaction, who fulfils the condition, and the transfers are committed in sequence starting with the last and ending with the first.\nThe ILP Packet format is defined in ASN.129 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), shown in Listing 6. The packet is encoded using the canonical Octet Encoding Rules.\nListing 6\nInterledgerProtocolPaymentMessage ::= SEQUENCE {\n    -- Amount which must be received at the destination amount UInt64,\n    -- Destination ILP Address account Address,\n    -- Information for recipient (transport layer information) data OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..32767)),\n    -- Enable ASN.1 Extensibility\n    extensions SEQUENCE {\n        ...\n    }\n}\nListing 6 -- The ILP Packet format in ASN.1 format\nNote: The only mandatory data elements in the ILP Packet are the amount to be transferred to the account of the Payee and the ILP Address of the Payee.\n24  https://interledger.org/rfcs/0011-interledger-payment-request/ -- Interledger Payment Request (IPR)\n25  https://interledger.org/ -- Interledger\n26 https://interledger.org/interledger.pdf -- A Protocol for Interledger Payments\n27  https://interledger.org/rfcs/0001-interledger-architecture/ -- Interledger Architecture\n28  https://interledger.org/rfcs/0015-ilp-addresses/ -- ILP Addresses\n29  https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-X.696-201508-I!!PDF-E&type=items -- Information technology -- ASN.1 encoding rules: Specification of Octet Encoding Rules (OER)\n5. Common API Functionality\nThis section describes the common functionality used by the API, including:\n\nQuoting\nParty Addressing\nMapping of Use Cases to Transaction Types\n\n5.1 Quoting\nQuoting is the process that determines any fees and any commission required to perform a financial transaction between two FSPs. It is always initiated by the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP, which means that the quote flows in the same way as a financial transaction.\nTwo different modes for quoting between FSPs are supported in the API: Non-disclosing of fees and Disclosing of fees.\n\nNon-Disclosing of fees should be used when either the Payer FSP does not want to show the Payee FSP its fee structure, or when the Payer FSP would like to have more control of the fees paid by the Payer after quoting has been performed (the latter is only applicable for Receive amount; see next bullet list).\n\nDisclosing of fees can be used for use cases in which the Payee FSP wants to subsidize the transaction in some use cases; for  example, Cash-In at another FSP's agent.\n\n\nThe Non-Disclosing of fees mode should be the standard supported way of quoting in most schemes. Disclosing of fees might be used in some schemes; for example, a scheme in which a dynamic fee structure is used and a FSP wants the ability to subsidize the Cash-In use case based on the dynamic cost.\nIn addition, the Payer can decide if the amount should be Receive amount or Send amount.\n\nSend amount should be interpreted as the actual amount that should be deducted from the Payer's account, including any fees.\n\nReceive amount should be interpreted as the amount that should be added to the Payee's account, regardless of any interoperable transaction fees. The amount excludes possible internal Payee fees added by the Payee FSP.\n\n\nThe Payee FSP can choose if the actual receive amount for the Payee should be sent or not in the callback to the Payer FSP. The actual Payee receive amount should include any Payee FSP internal fees on the Payee.\nAll taxes are assumed to be FSP-internal, which means that taxes are not sent as part of the API. See Section 5.1.5 for more information regarding taxes.\nNote: Dynamic fees implemented using a Switch, or any other intermediary, are not supported in this version of the API.\n5.1.1 Non-Disclosing of Fees\nThe fees and commission payments related to an interoperable transaction when fees are not disclosed are shown in Figure 6. The fees and commission that are directly part of the API are identified by green text. The FSP internal fees, commission, and bonus payments are identified by red text. These are not part of the transaction between a Payer FSP and a Payee FSP, but the amount that the Payee will receive after any FSP internal fees can be sent for information by the Payee FSP.\nFor send amount (see Section 5.1.1.2 for more information), internal Payer FSP fees on the Payer will affect the amount that is sent from the Payer FSP. For example, if the Payer FSP has a fee of 1 USD for a 100 USD interoperable financial transaction, 99 USD is sent from the Payer FSP. For receive amount (see Section 5.1.1.1 for more information), internal Payer FSP fees on the Payer will not affect the amount that is sent from the Payer FSP. Internal Payer FSP bonus or commission on the Payer should be hidden regardless of send or receive amount.\nFigure 6\n\nFigure 6 -- Fees and commission related to interoperability when fees are not disclosed\nSee Section 5.1.3 for more information on the fee types sent in the Interoperability API.\n5.1.1.1 Non-Disclosing Receive Amount\nFigure 7 shows an example of non-disclosing receive amount, in which the Payer would like the Payee to receive exactly 100 USD. For non-disclosing receive amount, the Payer FSP need not set the internal rating of the transaction until after the quote has been received because the Payee FSP knows what amount it will receive.\nIn this example, the Payee FSP decides to give commission to the Payer FSP since funds are flowing to the Payee FSP, which will later be spent in some way; this results in a future fee income for the Payee FSP. The Payer FSP can then decide how much in fees should be taken from the Payer for cost-plus pricing. In this example, the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD from the Payer, which means that the Payer FSP will earn 2 USD in total, as the Payer FSP will also receive 1 USD in FSP commission from the Payee FSP.\nFigure 7\n\nFigure 7 -- Example of non-disclosing receive amount\nFigure 8\n\nFigure 8 -- Simplified view of money movement for non-disclosing receive amount example\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a non-disclosing receive amount quote, the equation in Listing 9 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, Payee FSP fee is payeeFspFee in Table 18, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 7\nTransfer amount = Quote Amount + Payee FSP Fee -- Payee FSP Commission\nListing 7 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for non-disclosing receive amount\n5.1.1.2 Non-Disclosing Send Amount\nFigure 9 shows an example of non-disclosing send amount, where the Payer would like to send 100 USD from the Payer's account. For non-disclosing send amount, the Payer FSP must rate (determine the internal transaction fees, commission, or both) the transaction before the quote is sent to the Payee FSP so that the Payee FSP knows how much in funds it will receive in the transaction. The actual amount withdrawn from the Payer's account is not disclosed, nor are the fees.\nIn the example, the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP would like to have 1 USD each in fees so that the amount that will be received by the Payee is 98 USD. The actual amount that will be received by the Payee is in this example (not mandatory) returned in the callback to the Payer FSP, in the element payeeReceiveAmount.\nFigure 9\n\nFigure 9 -- Example of non-disclosing send amount\nFigure 10\nFigure 10 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the non-disclosing send amount example.\n\nFigure 10 -- Simplified view of money movement for non-disclosing send amount example\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a non-disclosing send amount quote, the equation in Listing 8 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 8\nTransfer amount = Quote Amount -- Payee FSP Commission\nListing 8 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for non-disclosing send amount\nThe reason for a Payee FSP fee to be absent in the equation is that the Payer would like to send a certain amount from their account. The Payee will receive less funds instead of a fee being added on top of the amount.\nThe fees and commission payments related to an interoperable transaction when fees are disclosed can be seen in Figure 11. The fees and commission that are directly related to the API are marked with green text. Internal Payee fees, bonus, and commission are marked with red text, these will have an implication on the amount that is sent by the Payer and received by the Payee. They are not part of the interoperable transaction between a Payer FSP and a Payee FSP, but the actual amount to be received by the Payee after internal Payee FSP fees have been deducted can be sent for information by the Payee FSP.\nWhen disclosing of fees are used, the FSP commission that the Payee FSP sends should subsidize the transaction cost for the Payer. This means that any FSP commission sent from the Payee FSP will effectively pay either a part or all of the fees that the Payer FSP has added to the transaction. If the FSP commission amount from the Payee FSP is higher than the actual transaction fees for the Payer, the excess amount should be handled as a fee paid by Payee FSP to Payer FSP. Section 5.1.2.2.1 contains an example of excess FSP commission.\nFigure 11\n\nFigure 11 -- Fees and commission related to interoperability when fees\nare disclosed\nSee Section 5.1.3 for more information on the fee types sent in the Interoperability API.\n5.1.2.1 Disclosing Receive Amount\nFigure 12 shows an example of disclosing receive amount where the Payer would like the Payee to receive exactly 100 USD. For disclosing receive amount, the Payer FSP must internally rate the transaction before the quote request is sent to the Payee FSP, because the fees are disclosed. In this example, the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees from the Payer. The Payee FSP decides to give 1 USD in commission to subsidize the transaction, so that the transaction is free for the Payer.\n\nFigure 12 -- Example of disclosing receive amount\nFigure 13\nFigure 13 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the disclosing receive amount example.\n\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a disclosing receive amount quote, the equation in Listing 9 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, Payee FSP fee is payeeFspFee in Table 18, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 9\nTransfer amount = Quote Amount + Payee FSP Fee -- Payee FSP Commission\nListing 9 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for disclosing receive amount\n5.1.2.2 Disclosing Send Amount\nFigure 14 shows an example of disclosing send amount, where the Payer would like to send 100 USD from the Payer's account to the Payee. For disclosing send amount, the Payer FSP must rate the transaction before the quote request is sent to the Payee FSP, because the fees are disclosed. In this example, the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP would like to have 1 USD each in fees from the Payer.\nFigure 14\n\nFigure 14 -- Example of disclosing send amount\nFigure 15\nFigure 15 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the disclosing send amount example.\n\nFigure 15 -- Simplified view of money movement for disclosing send amount example\nTo calculate the element transferAmount in the Payee FSP for a disclosing send amount quote, the equation in Listing 10 should be used, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Quote Amount is amount in Table 17, Payer Fee is fees in Table 17, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 10\nIf (Payer Fee Listing 10 -- Relation between transfer amount and quote amount for disclosing send amount\nThe reason for a Payee FSP fee to be absent in the equation, is that the Payer would like to send a certain amount from their account. The Payee will receive less funds instead of a fee being added on top of the amount.\n5.1.2.2.1 Excess FSP Commission Example\nFigure 16 shows an example of excess FSP commission using disclosing send amount, where the Payer would like to send 100 USD from the Payer's account to the Payee. For disclosing send amount, the Payer FSP must rate the transaction before the quote request is sent to the Payee FSP, because the fees are disclosed. In this excess commission example, the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees from the Payer, and the Payee FSP gives 3 USD in FSP commission. Out of the 3 USD in FSP commission, 1 USD should cover the Payer fees, and 2 USD is for the Payer FSP to keep.\nFigure 16\n\nFigure 16 -- Example of disclosing send amount\nFigure 17\nFigure 17 shows a simplified view of the movement of money for the excess commission using disclosing send amount example.\n\nFigure 17 -- Simplified view of money movement for excess commission using disclosing send amount example\n5.1.3 Fee Types\nAs can be seen in Figure 6 and Figure 11, there are two different fee and commission types in the Quote object between the\nFSPs:\n\nPayee FSP fee -- A transaction fee that the Payee FSP would like to have for the handling of the transaction.\n\nPayee FSP commission -- A commission that the Payee FSP would like to give to the Payer FSP (non-disclosing of fees) or subsidize the transaction by paying some or all fees from the Payer FSP (disclosing of fees). In case of excess FSP commission, the excess commission should be handled as the Payee FSP pays a fee to the Payer FSP, see Section 5.1.2.2.1 for an example.\n\n\n5.1.4 Quote Equations\nThis section contains useful equations for quoting that have not already been mentioned.\n5.1.4.1 Payee Receive Amount Relation to Transfer Amount\nThe amount that the Payee should receive, excluding any internal Payee FSP fees, bonus, or commission, can be calculated by the Payer FSP using the equation in Listing 11, where Transfer Amount is transferAmount in Table 18, Payee FSP fee is payeeFspFee in Table 18, and Payee FSP commission is payeeFspCommission in Table 18.\nListing 11\nPayee Receive Amount = Transfer Amount - Payee FSP Fee + Payee FSP Commission\nListing 11 -- Relation between transfer amount and Payee receive amount\nThe actual Payee receive amount including any internal Payee FSP fees can optionally be sent by the Payee FSP to the Payer FSP in the Quote callback, see element payeeReceiveAmount in Table 18.\n5.1.5 Tax Information\nTax information is not sent in the API, as all taxes are assumed to be FSP-internal. The following sections contain details pertaining to common tax types related to the API.\n5.1.5.1 Tax on Agent Commission\nTax on Agent Commission is tax for an Agent as a result of the Agent receiving commission as a kind of income. Either the Agent or its FSP has a relation with the tax authority, depending on how the FSP deployment is set up. As all Agent commissions are FSP-internal, no information is sent through the Interoperability API regarding Tax on Agent Commission.\n5.1.5.2 Tax on FSP Internal Fee\nFSPs could be taxed on FSP internal fees that they receive from the transactions; for example, Payer fees to Payer FSP or Payee fees to Payee FSP. This tax should be handled internally within the FSP and collected by the FSPs because they receive a fee.\n5.1.5.3 Tax on Amount (Consumption tax)\nExamples of tax on amount are VAT (Value Added Tax) and Sales Tax. These types of taxes are typically paid by a Consumer to the Merchant as part of the price of goods, services, or both. It is the Merchant who has a relationship with the tax authority, and forwards the collected taxes to the tax authority. If any VAT or Sales Tax is applicable, a Merchant should include these taxes in the requested amount from the Consumer. The received amount in the Payee FSP should then be taxed accordingly.\n5.1.5.4 Tax on FSP Fee\nIn the API, there is a possibility for a Payee FSP to add a fee that the Payer or Payer FSP should pay to the Payee FSP. The Payee FSP should handle the tax internally as normal when receiving a fee (if local taxes apply). This means that the Payee FSP should consider the tax on the fee while rating the financial transaction as part of the quote. The tax is not sent as part of the API.\n5.1.5.5 Tax on FSP Commission\nIn the API, there is a possibility for a Payee FSP to add a commission to either subsidize the transaction (if disclosing of fees) or incentivize the Payer FSP (if non-disclosing of fees).\n5.1.5.5.1 Non-Disclosing of Fees\nFor non-disclosing of fees, all FSP commission from the Payee FSP should understood as the Payer FSP receiving a fee from the Payee FSP. The tax on the received fee should be handled internally within the Payer FSP, similar to the way it is handled in Section 5.1.5.2.\n5.1.5.5.2 Disclosing of Fees\nIf the Payee FSP commission amount is less than or equal to the amount of transaction fees originating from the Payer FSP, then the Payee FSP commission should always be understood as being used for covering fees that the Payer would otherwise need to pay.\nIf the Payee FSP commission amount is higher than the fees from the Payer FSP, the excess FSP commission should be handled similarly as Section 5.1.5.5.1.\n5.1.6 Examples for each Use Case\nThis section contains one or more examples for each use case.\n5.1.6.1 P2P Transfer\nA P2P Transfer is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 18 for an example. In this example, the Payer would like the Payee to receive 100 USD. The Payee FSP decides to give FSP commission to the Payer FSP, because the Payee FSP will receive funds into the system. The Payer FSP would also like to have 1 USD in fee from the Payer, so the total fee that the Payer FSP will earn is 2 USD. 99 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP after deducting the FSP commission amount of 1 USD.\nFigure 18\n\nFigure 18 -- P2P Transfer example with receive amount\n5.1.6.1.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 19\nSee Figure 19 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the P2P Transfer example.\n\nFigure 19 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the P2P Transfer example\n5.1.6.2 Agent-Initiated Cash-In (Send amount)\nFigure 20 shows an example of an Agent-Initiated Cash-In where send amount is used. The fees are disclosed because the Payee (the customer) would like to know the fees in advance of accepting the Cash-In. In the example, the Payee would like to Cash-In a 100 USD bill using an Agent (the Payer) in the Payer FSP system. The Payer FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission. The Payee FSP decides to subsidize the transaction by 2 USD by giving 2 USD in FSP commission to cover the Payer FSP fees. 98 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP after deducting the FSP commission amount of 2 USD.\nFigure 20\n\nFigure 20 -- Agent-Initiated Cash-In example with send amount\n5.1.6.2.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 21 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In example with send amount.\nFigure 21\n\nFigure 21 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In with send amount example\n5.1.6.3 Agent-Initiated Cash-In\n(Receive amount)\nFigure 22 shows an example of Agent-Initiated Cash-In where receive amount is used. The fees are disclosed as the Payee (the Consumer) would like to know the fees in advance of accepting the Cash-In. In the example, the Payee would like to Cash-In so that they receive 100 USD using an Agent (the Payer) in the Payer FSP system. The Payer FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission; the Payee FSP decides to subsidize the transaction by 1 USD by giving 1 USD in FSP commission to cover 50% of the Payer FSP fees. 99 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP after deducting the FSP commission amount of 1 USD.\nFigure 22\n\nFigure 22 -- Agent-initiated Cash-In example with receive amount\n5.1.6.3.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 19\nSee Figure 23 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In example with receive amount.\n\nFigure 23 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-initiated Cash-In with receive amount example\n5.1.6.4 Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment\nA Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 24 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to buy goods or services worth 100 USD from a Merchant (the Payee) in the Payee FSP system. The Payee FSP would not like to charge any fees from the Payer, but 1 USD in an internal hidden fee from the Merchant. The Payer FSP wants 1 USD in fees from the Payer. 100 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 24\n\nFigure 24 -- Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.4.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 25\nSee Figure 25 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment example.\n\nFigure 25 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.5 Customer-Initiated Cash-Out\n(Receive amount)\nA Customer-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 26 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out so that they will receive 100 USD in cash. The Payee FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 102 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\n\nFigure 26 -- Customer-Initiated Cash-Out example (receive amount)\n5.1.6.5.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nFigure 27\nSee Figure 27 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with receive amount example.\n\nFigure 27 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with receive amount example\n5.1.6.6 Customer-Initiated Cash-Out\n(Send amount)\nA Customer-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, this\nexample is shown in Section 5.1.6.5. This section shows an example where send amount is used instead; see Figure 28 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out 100 USD from their account. The Payee FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 99 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 28\n\nFigure 28 -- Customer-Initiated Cash-Out example (send amount)\n5.1.6.6.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 29 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with send amount example.\nFigure 29\n\nFigure 29 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Customer-Initiated Cash-Out with send amount example\n5.1.6.7 Agent-Initiated Cash-Out\nAn Agent-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, in which the Payer FSP does not disclose any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 30 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out so that they will receive 100 USD in cash. The Payee FSP would like to have 2 USD in fees to cover the agent commission and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 102 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 30\n\nFigure 30 -- Agent-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.7.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 31 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-Initiated Cash-Out example.\nFigure 31\n\nFigure 31 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Agent-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.8 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment\nA Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment is typically a receive amount, where the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 32 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to buy goods or services worth 100 USD from a Merchant (the Payee) in the Payee FSP system. The Payee FSP does not want any fees and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fee. 100 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 32\n\nFigure 32 -- Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.8.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 33 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment example.\nFigure 33\n\nFigure 33 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment example\n5.1.6.9 ATM-Initiated Cash-Out**\nAn ATM-Initiated Cash-Out is typically a receive amount, in which the Payer FSP is not disclosing any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 34 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to Cash-Out so that they will receive 100 USD in cash. The Payee FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees to cover any ATM fees and the Payer FSP would like to have 1 USD in fees. 101 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 34\n\nFigure 34 -- ATM-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.9.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 35 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the ATM-Initiated Cash-Out example.\nFigure 35\n\nFigure 35 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the ATM-Initiated Cash-Out example\n5.1.6.10 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS\nA Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on a POS device is typically a receive amount, in which the Payer FSP does not disclose any fees to the Payee FSP. See Figure 36 for an example. In the example, the Payer would like to buy goods or services worth 100 USD from a Merchant (the Payee) in the Payee FSP system. The Payee FSP decides to give 1 USD in FSP commission, and the Payer FSP decides to use the FSP commission as the transaction fee. 100 USD is transferred from the Payer FSP to the Payee FSP.\nFigure 36\n\nFigure 36 -- Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS example\n5.1.6.10.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 37 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS example.\nFigure 37\n\nFigure 37 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the\nMerchant-Initiated Merchant Payment authorized on POS example\n5.1.6.11 Refund\nFigure 38 shows an example of a Refund transaction of the entire amount of the example in Section 5.1.6.3, Agent-Initiated Cash-In (Receive amount)\nFigure 38\n\nFigure 38 -- Refund example\n5.1.6.11.1 Simplified View of Money Movement\nSee Figure 39 for a highly simplified view of the movement of money for the Refund example.\nFigure 39\n\nFigure 39 -- Simplified view of the movement of money for the Refund example\n5.2 Party Addressing\nBoth Parties in a financial transaction, (that is, the Payer and the Payee) are addressed in the API by a Party ID Type (element PartyIdType, Section 7.3.25), a Party ID (PartyIdentifier, Section 7.3.24), and an optional Party Sub ID or Type (PartySubIdOrType, Section 7.3.27). Some Sub-Types are pre-defined in the API for personal identifiers (PersonalIdentifierType, Section 7.5.7); for example, for passport number or driver's license number.\nThe following are basic examples of how the elements Party ID Type and Party ID can be used:\n\nTo use mobile phone number +123456789 as the counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to MSISDN and Party ID to +123456789.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/MSISDN/+123456789\n\n\n\nTo use the email john\\@doe.com as the counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to EMAIL, and Party ID to john\\@doe.com.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/EMAIL/john\\@doe.com\n\n\n\nTo use the IBAN account number SE45 5000 0000 0583 9825 7466 as counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to IBAN, and Party ID to SE4550000000058398257466 (should be entered without any whitespace).\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/IBAN/SE4550000000058398257466\n\n\n\n\nThe following are more advanced examples of how the elements Party ID\nType, Party ID, and Party Sub ID or Type can be used:\n\nTo use the person who has passport number 12345678 as counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to PERSONAL_ID, Party ID to 12345678, and Party Sub ID or Type to PASSPORT.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/PERSONAL_ID/123456789/PASSPORT\n\n\n\nTo use employeeId1 working in the company Shoe-company as counterparty in a financial transaction, set Party ID Type to BUSINESS, Party ID to Shoe-company, and Party Sub ID or Type to employeeId1.\n\nExample service to get FSP information:\nGET /participants/BUSINESS/Shoe-company/employeeId1\n\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Restricted Characters in Party ID and Party Sub ID or Type\nBecause the Party ID and the Party Sub ID or Type are used as part of the URI (see Section 3.1.3), some restrictions exist on the ID:\n\nForward slash (/) is not allowed in the ID, as it is used by the Path (see Section 3.1.3.3), to indicate a separation of the Path.\n\nQuestion mark (?) is not allowed in the ID, as it is used to indicate the Query (see Section 3.1.3.4) part of the URI.\n\n\n5.3 Mapping of Use Cases to Transaction Types\nThis section contains information about how to map the currently supported non-bulk use cases in the API to the complex type TransactionType (see Section 7.4.18), using the elements TransactionScenario (see Section 7.3.32), and TransactionInitiator, (see Section 7.3.29).\nFor more information regarding these use cases, see API Use Cases.\n5.3.1 P2P Transfer\nTo perform a P2P Transfer, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to TRANSFER\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to CONSUMER.\n\n5.3.2 Agent-Initiated Cash In\nTo perform an Agent-Initiated Cash In, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to DEPOSIT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to AGENT.\n\n5.3.3 Agent-Initiated Cash Out\nTo perform an Agent-Initiated Cash Out, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to AGENT\n\n5.3.4 Agent-Initiated Cash Out Authorized on POS\nTo perform an Agent-Initiated Cash Out on POS, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to AGENT\n\n5.3.5 Customer-Initiated Cash Out\nTo perform a Customer-Initiated Cash Out, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to CONSUMER\n\n5.3.6 Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment\nTo perform a Customer-Initiated Merchant Payment, set elements as\nfollows:\n\nTransactionScenario to PAYMENT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType to CONSUMER.\n\n5.3.7 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment\nTo perform a Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment, set elements as\nfollows:\n\nTransactionScenario to PAYMENT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to BUSINESS\n\n5.3.8 Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment Authorized on POS\nTo perform a Merchant-Initiated Merchant Payment, set elements as\nfollows:\n\nTransactionScenario to PAYMENT\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to DEVICE\n\n5.3.9 ATM-Initiated Cash Out\nTo perform an ATM-Initiated Cash Out, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to WITHDRAWAL\nTransactionInitiator to PAYEE\nTransactionInitiatorType to DEVICE\n\n5.3.10 Refund\nTo perform a Refund, set elements as follows:\n\nTransactionScenario to REFUND\nTransactionInitiator to PAYER\nTransactionInitiatorType depends on the initiator of the Refund.\n\nAdditionally, the Refund complex type, see Section 7.4.16, must be populated with the transaction ID of the original transaction that is to be refunded.\n6. API Services\nThis section introduces and details all services that the API supports for each resource and HTTP method. Each API resource and service is also mapped to a logical API resource and service described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\n6.1 High Level API Services\nOn a high level, the API can be used to perform the following actions:\n\nLookup Participant Information -- Find out in which FSP the counterparty in a financial transaction is located.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /participants.\n\n\nLookup Party Information -- Get information about the counterparty in a financial transaction.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /parties.\n\n\nPerform Transaction Request -- Request that a Payer transfer electronic funds to the Payee, at the request of the Payee. The Payer can approve or reject the request from the Payee. An approval of the request will initiate the actual financial transaction.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /transactionRequests.\n\n\nCalculate Quote -- Calculate all parts of a transaction that will influence the transaction amount; that is, fees and FSP commission.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /quotes for a single transaction quote; that is, one Payer to one Payee.\nUse the services provided by the API resource /bulkQuotes for a bulk transaction quote; that is, one Payer to multiple Payees.\n\n\nPerform Authorization -- Request the Payer to enter the applicable credentials when they have initiated the transaction from a POS, ATM, or similar device in the Payee FSP system.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /authorizations.\n\n\nPerform Transfer -- Perform the actual financial transaction by transferring the electronic funds from the Payer to the Payee, possibly through intermediary ledgers.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /transfers for single transaction; that is, one Payer to one Payee.\nUse the services provided by the API resource /bulkTransfers for bulk transaction; that is, one Payer to multiple Payees.\n\n\nRetrieve Transaction Information -- Get information related to the financial transaction; for example, a possible created token on successful financial transaction.\n\nUse the services provided by the API resource /transactions.\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Supported API services\nTable 5\nTable 5 includes high-level descriptions of the services that the API provides.

Depending on the scheme, the services should be supported, at a minimum, by either the individual FSPs or a common service.\nIf a common service (for example, an ALS) is supported in the scheme, the services provided by the resource /participants can also be used by the FSPs for adding and deleting information in that system.\n6.2.1 Service Details\nDifferent models are used for account lookup, depending on whether an ALS exists. The following sections describe each model in turn.\n6.2.1.1 No Common Account Lookup System\nFigure 40 shows how an account lookup can be performed if there is no common ALS in a scheme. The process is to ask the other FSPs (in sequence) if they \"own\" the Party with the provided identity and type pair until the Party can be found.\nIf this model is used, all FSPs should support being both client and server of the different HTTP GET services under the /participants resource. The HTTP POST or HTTP DELETE services under the /participants resource should not be used, as the FSPs are directly used for retrieving the information (instead of a common ALS).\nFigure 40\n\nFigure 40 -- How to use the services provided by /participants if there is no common Account Lookup System\n6.2.1.2 Common Account Lookup System\nFigure 41 shows how an account lookup can be performed if there is a common ALS in a scheme. The process is to ask the common Account Lookup service which FSP owns the Party with the provided identity. The common service is depicted as \"Account Lookup\" in the flows; this service could either be implemented by the switch or as a separate service, depending on the setup in the market.\nThe FSPs do not need to support the server side of the different HTTP GET services under the /participants resource; the server side of the service should be handled by the ALS. Instead, the FSPs (clients) should provide FSP information regarding its accounts and account holders (parties) to the ALS (server) using the HTTP POST (to create or update FSP information, see Section 6.2.2.2 and Section 6.2.2.3) and HTTP DELETE (to delete existing FSP information, see Section 6.2.2.4) methods.\nFigure 41\n\nFigure 41 -- How to use the services provided by /participants if there is a common Account Lookup System\n6.2.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client on the resource /participants.\n6.2.2.1 GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nAlternative URI: GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}\nLogical API service: Lookup Participant Information\nThe HTTP request GET /participants/{Type}/{ID} (or GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}) is used to find out in which FSP the requested Party, defined by {Type}, {ID} and optionally {SubId}, is located (for example, GET /participants/MSISDN/123456789, or GET /participants/BUSINESS/shoecompany/employee1). See Section 5.1.6.11 for more information regarding addressing of a Party.\nThis HTTP request should support a query string (see Section 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) for filtering of currency. To use filtering of currency, the HTTP request GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}?currency=XYZ should be used, where XYZ is the requested currency.\nCallback and data model information for GET /participants/{Type}/{ID} (alternative GET /participants/{Type}/{ID}/{SubId}):\n\nCallback - PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}\nError Callback - PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.2.2.2 POST /participants\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Create Bulk Participant Information\nThe HTTP request POST /participants is used to create information on the server regarding the provided list of identities. This request should be used for bulk creation of FSP information for more than one Party.

The Payer can either approve or reject the request from the Payee. The decision by the Payer could be made programmatically if:\n\nThe Payee is trusted (that is, the Payer has pre-approved the Payee in the Payer FSP), or\n\nAn authorization value - that is, a one-time password (OTP) is correctly validated using the API Resource /authorizations, see Section 6.6.\n\n\nAlternatively, the Payer could make the decision manually.\n6.4.1 Service Details\nFigure 43 shows how the request transaction process works, using the /transactionRequests resource. The approval or rejection is not shown in the figure. A rejection is a callback PUT /transactionRequests/{ID} with a REJECTED state, similar to the callback in the figure with the RECEIVED state, as described in Section 6.4.1.1. An approval by the Payer is not sent as a callback; instead a quote and transfer are sent containing a reference to the transaction request.\nFigure 43\n\nFigure 43 -- How to use the /transactionRequests service\n6.4.1.1 Payer Rejected Transaction Request\nFigure 44 shows the process by which a transaction request is rejected. Possible reasons for rejection include:\n\nThe Payer rejected the request manually.\nAn automatic limit was exceeded.\nThe Payer entered an OTP incorrectly more than the allowed number of times.\n\nFigure 44\n\nFigure 44 -- Example process in which a transaction request is rejected\n6.4.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that a client can request on the resource /transactionRequests.\n6.4.2.1 GET /transactionRequests/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Transaction Request Information\nThe HTTP request GET /transactionRequests/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested transaction request.

This means that a client should expect that an error callback could be received for a rejected transaction request.\n\nFigure 45 -- Possible states of a transaction request\n6.5 API Resource /quotes\nThis section defines the logical API resource Quotes, described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nThe main service provided by the API resource /quotes is calculation of possible fees and FSP commission involved in performing an interoperable financial transaction. Both the Payer and Payee FSP should calculate their part of the quote to be able to get a total view of all the fees and FSP commission involved in the transaction.\nA quote is irrevocable; it cannot be changed after it has been created. However, it can expire (all quotes are valid only until they reach expiration).\nNote: A quote is not a guarantee that the financial transaction will succeed. The transaction can still fail later in the process. A quote only guarantees that the fees and FSP commission involved in performing the specified financial transaction are applicable until the quote expires.\nFor more information regarding Quoting, see Section 5.1.\n6.5.1 Service Details\nFigure 46 contains an example process for the API resource /quotes. The example shows a Payer Initiated Transaction, but it could also be initiated by the Payee, using the API Resource /transactionRequests, Section 6.4. The lookup process is in that case performed by the Payee FSP instead.\nFigure 46\n\nFigure 46 -- Example process for resource /quotes\n6.5.1.1 Quote Expiry Details\nThe quote request from the Payer FSP can contain an expiry of the quote, if the Payer FSP would like to indicate when it is no longer useful for the Payee FSP to return a quote. For example, the transaction itself might otherwise time out, or if its quote might time out.\nThe Payee FSP should set an expiry of the quote in the callback to indicate when the quote is no longer valid for use by the Payer FSP.\n6.5.1.2 Interledger Payment Request\nAs part of supporting Interledger and the concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request (see Section 4), the\nPayee FSP must:\n\nDetermine the ILP Address (see Section 4.3 for more information) of the Payee and the amount that the Payee will receive. Note that since the amount element in the ILP Packet is defined as an UInt64, which is an Integer value, the amount should be multiplied with the currency's exponent (for example, USD's exponent is 2, which means the amount should be multiplied by 102, and JPY's exponent is 0, which means the amount should be multiplied by 100). Both the ILP Address and the amount should be populated in the ILP Packet (see Section 4.5 for more information).\n\nPopulate the data element in the ILP Packet by the Transaction (Section 7.4.17) data model.\n\nGenerate the fulfilment and the condition (see Section 4.4 for more information). Populate the condition element in the PUT /quotes/{ID}(#6531-put-quotesid) (Table 18) data model with the generated condition.\n\nThe fulfilment is a temporary secret that is generated for each financial transaction by the Payee FSP and used as the trigger to commit the transfers that make up an ILP payment.\nThe Payee FSP uses a local secret to generate a SHA-256 HMAC of the ILP Packet. The same secret may be used for all financial transactions or the Payee FSP may store a different secret per Payee or based on another segmentation.\nThe choice and cardinality of the local secret is an implementation decision that may be driven by scheme rules. The only requirement is that the Payee FSP can determine which secret that was used when the ILP Packet is received back later as part of an incoming transfer (see Section 6.7).\nThe fulfilment and condition are generated in accordance with the algorithm defined in Listing 12. Once the Payee FSP has derived the condition, the fulfilment can be discarded as it can be regenerated later.\nListing 12\nGeneration of the fulfilment and condition\n\n**Inputs:**\n\n- Local secret (32-byte binary string)\n- ILP Packet\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1. Let the fulfilment be the result of executing the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm on the ILP Packet using the local secret as the key.\n\n2. Let the condition be the result of executing the SHA-256 hash algorithm on the fulfilment.\n\n**Outputs:**\n\n- Fulfilment (32-byte binary string)\n- Condition (32-byte binary string)\nListing 12 -- Algorithm to generate the fulfilment and the condition\n6.5.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /quotes.\n6.5.2.1 GET /quotes/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Quote Information\nThe HTTP request GET /quotes/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested quote.

This means that a client should expect that an error callback could be received for an expired or rejected quote.\n\nFigure 47 -- Possible states of a quote\n6.6 API Resource /authorizations\nThis section defines the logical API resource Authorizations,described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nThe API resource /authorizations is used to request the Payer to enter the applicable credentials in the Payee FSP system for approving the financial transaction, when the Payer has initiated the transaction from a POS, ATM, or similar, in the Payee FSP system and would like to authorize by an OTP.\n6.6.1 Service Details\nFigure 48 contains an example process for the API resource /authorizations. The Payee FSP first sends a transaction request (see Section 6.4) that is authorized using OTP. The Payer FSP then performs the quoting process (see Section 6.5) before an authorization request is sent to the Payee FSP system for the Payer to approve by entering the OTP. If the OTP is correct, the transfer process should be initiated (see Section 6.7).\nFigure 48\n\nFigure 48 -- Example process for resource /authorizations\n6.6.1.1 Resend Authorization Value\nIf the notification containing the authorization value fails to reach the Payer, the Payer can choose to request a resend of the authorization value if the POS, ATM, or similar device supports such a request. See Figure 49 for an example of a process where the Payer requests that the OTP be resent.\nFigure 49\n\nFigure 49 -- Payer requests resend of authorization value (OTP)\n6.6.1.2 Retry Authorization Value\nThe Payer FSP must decide the number of times a Payer can retry the authorization value in the POS, ATM, or similar device. This will be set in the retriesLeft query string (see 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) of the GET /authorizations/{ID} service, see Section 6.6.2.1 for more information. If the Payer FSP sends retriesLeft=1, this means that it is the Payer's last try of the authorization value. See Figure 50 for an example process where the Payer enters the incorrect OTP, and the retriesLeft value is subsequently decreased.\nFigure 50\n\nFigure 50 -- Payer enters incorrect authorization value (OTP)\n6.6.1.3 Failed OTP authorization\nIf the user fails to enter the correct OTP within the number of allowed retries, the process described in Section 6.4.1.1 is performed.\n6.6.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /authorizations.\n6.6.2.1 GET /authorizations/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Perform Authorization\nThe HTTP request GET /authorizations/{ID} is used to request the Payer to enter the applicable credentials in the Payee FSP system. The {ID} in the URI should contain the transactionRequestID (see Table 14), received from the POST /transactionRequests (see Section 6.4.2.2) service earlier in the process.\nThis request requires a query string (see Section 3.1.3 for more information regarding URI syntax) to be included in the URI, with the following key-value pairs:\n\nauthenticationType={Type}, where {Type} value is a valid authentication type from the enumeration AuthenticationType (see Section 7.5.1).\nretriesLeft={NrOfRetries}, where {NrOfRetries} is the number of retries left before the financial transaction is rejected. {NrOfRetries} must be expressed in the form of the data type Integer (see Section 7.2.5). retriesLeft=1 means that this is the last retry before the financial transaction is rejected.\namount={Amount}, where {Amount} is the transaction amount that will be withdrawn from the Payer's account. {Amount} must be expressed in the form of the data type Amount (see Section 7.2.13).\ncurrency={Currency}, where {Currency} is the transaction currency for the amount that will be withdrawn from the Payer's account. The {Currency} value must be expressed in the form of the enumeration CurrencyCode (see Section 7.5.5).\n\nAn example URI containing all the required key-value pairs in the query string is the following:\nGET /authorization/3d492671-b7af-4f3f-88de-76169b1bdf88?authenticationType=OTP&retriesLeft=2&amount=102&currency=USD\nCallback and data model information for GET /authorization/{ID}:\n\nCallback - PUT /authorizations/{ID}\nError Callback - PUT /authorizations/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.6.3 Callbacks\nThis section describes the callbacks that are used by the server under the resource /authorizations.\n6.6.3.1 PUT /authorizations/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Return Authorization Result\nThe callback PUT /authorizations/ {ID} is used to inform the client of the result of a previously-requested authorization.

The transaction details are sent as part of the transfer data model in the ILP Packet.\nThe Interledger protocol assumes that the setup of a financial transaction is achieved using an end-to-end protocol, but that an ILP transfer is implemented on the back of hop-by-hop protocols between FSPs connected to a common ledger. In the current version of the API, the API Resource /quotes performs the setup of the financial transaction. Before a transfer can be performed, the quote must be performed to setup the financial transaction. See API Resource /quotes, Section 6.5, for more information.\nAn ILP transfer is exchanged between two account holders on either side of a common ledger. It is usually expressed in the form of a request to execute a transfer on the common ledger and a notification to the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has been reserved in their favor, including a condition that must be fulfilled to commit the transfer.\nWhen the Payee FSP presents the fulfilment to the common ledger, the transfer is committed in the common ledger. At the same time, the Payer FSP is notified that the transfer has been committed along with the fulfilment.\n6.7.1 Service Details\nThis section provides details regarding hop-by-hop transfers and end-to-end financial transactions.\n6.7.1.1 Process\nFigure 51 shows how the transaction process works using the POST /transfers service.\nFigure 51\n\nFigure 51 -- How to use the POST /transfers service\n6.7.1.2 Transaction Irrevocability\nThe API is designed to support irrevocable financial transactions only; this means that a financial transaction cannot be changed, cancelled, or reversed after it has been created. This is to simplify and reduce costs for FSPs using the API. A large percentage of the operating costs of a typical financial system is due to reversals of transactions.\nAs soon as a Payer FSP sends a financial transaction to a Payee FSP (that is, using POST /transfers including the end-to-end financial transaction), the transaction is irrevocable from the perspective of the Payer FSP. The transaction could still be rejected in the Payee FSP, but the Payer FSP can no longer reject or change the transaction. An exception to this would be if the transfer's expiry time is exceeded before the Payee FSP responds (see Section 6.7.1.3 and Section 6.7.1.5 for more information). As soon as the financial transaction has been accepted by the Payee FSP, the transaction is irrevocable for all parties.\n6.7.1.3 Expired Quote\nIf a server receives a transaction that is using an expired quote, the server should reject the transfer or transaction.\n6.7.1.4 Timeout and Expiry\nThe Payer FSP must always set a transfer expiry time to allow for use cases in which a swift completion or failure is needed. If the use case does not require a swift completion, a longer expiry time can be set. If the Payee FSP fails to respond before the expiry time, the transaction is cancelled in the Payer FSP. The Payer FSP should still expect a callback from the Payee FSP.\nShort expiry times are often required in retail scenarios, in which a customer may be standing in front of a merchant; both parties need to know if the transaction was successful before the goods or services are given to the customer.\nIn Figure 51, an expiry has been set to 30 seconds from the current time in the request from the Payer FSP, and to 20 seconds from the same time in the request from the Switch to the Payee FSP. This strategy of using shorter timeouts for each entity in the chain from Payer FSP to Payee FSP should always be used to allow for extra communication time.\nNote: It is possible that a successful callback might be received in the Payer FSP after the expiry time; for example, due to congestion in the network. The Payer FSP should allow for some extra time after the actual expiry time before cancelling the financial transaction in the system. If a successful callback is received after the financial transaction has been cancelled, the transaction should be marked for reconciliation and handled separately in a reconciliation process.\n6.7.1.5 Client Receiving Expired Transfer\nFigure 52 shows an example of a possible error scenario connected to expiry and timeouts. For some reason, the callback from the Payee FSP takes longer time to send than the expiry time in the optional Switch. This leads to the Switch cancelling the reserved transfer, and an error callback for the transfer is sent to the Payer FSP. Now the Payer FSP and the Payee FSP have two different views of the result of the financial transaction; the transaction should be marked for reconciliation.\nFigure 52\n\nFigure 52 -- Client receiving an expired transfer\nTo limit these kinds of error scenarios, the clients (Payer FSP and optional Switch in Figure 52) participating in the ILP transfer should allow some extra time after actual expiry time during which the callback from the server can be received. The client or clients should also query the server after expiry, but before the end of the extra time, if any callback from the server has been lost due to communication failure. Reconciliation could still be necessary though, even with extra time allowed and querying the server for the transaction.\n6.7.1.6 Optional Additional Clearing Check\nTo further limit the possibility of the scenario described in Section 6.7.1.5, a Payee FSP can (if the scheme allows it) use an optional clearing check before performing the actual transfer to the Payee, by requesting the transfer state from the Switch after the fulfilment has been sent to Switch. The request of the transfer state is performed by sending a GET /transfers/{ID} to the Switch.\nThe use of the check is a business decision made by the Payee FSP (if  the scheme allows it), based on the context of the transaction. For example, a Cash Out or a Merchant Payment transaction can be understood as a higher-risk transaction, because it is not possible to reverse a transaction if the customer is no longer present; a P2P Transfer can be understood as lower risk because it is easier to reverse.\nFigure 53 shows an example where the optional additional clearing check is used where the commit was successful in the Switch.\nFigure 53\n\nFigure 53 -- Optional additional clearing check\nIf the GET /transfers/{ID} is received by the Switch after PUT /transfers/{ID} from the Payee FSP, but before clearing has completed, the Switch should wait with sending the callback until clearing has completed with either a successful or unsuccessful result. If clearing has already occurred (as shown in Figure 53), the PUT /transfers/{ID} callback can be sent immediately.\nFigure 54 shows an example in which the commit in the Switch failed due to an expiry of the transfer. This is the same example as in Figure 52, but where no reconciliation is needed as the Payee FSP checks if the transfer was successful or not in the Switch before performing the actual transfer to the Payee.\nFigure 54\n\nFigure 54 -- Optional additional clearing check where commit in Switch failed\n6.7.1.7 Refunds\nInstead of supporting reversals, the API supports refunds. To refund a transaction using the API, a new transaction should be created by the Payee of the original transaction. The new transaction should revers the original transaction (either the full amount or a partial amount); for example, if customer X sent 100 USD to merchant Y in the original transaction, a new transaction where merchant Y sends 100 USD to customer X should be created. There is a specific transaction type to indicate a refund transaction; for example, if the quote of the transaction should be handled differently than any other type of transaction. The original transaction ID should be sent as part of the new transaction for informational and reconciliation purposes.\n6.7.1.8 Interledger Payment Request\nAs part of supporting Interledger and the concrete implementation of the Interledger Payment Request (see Section 4), the Payer FSP must attach the ILP Packet, the condition, and an expiry to the transfer. The condition and the ILP Packet are the same as those sent by the Payee FSP in the callback of the quote; see Section 6.5.1.2 for more information.\nThe end-to-end ILP payment is a chain of one or more conditional transfers that all depend on the same condition. The condition is provided by the Payer FSP when it initiates the transfer to the next ledger.\nThe receiver of that transfer parses the ILP Packet to get the Payee ILP Address and routes the ILP payment by performing another transfer on the next ledger, attaching the same ILP Packet and condition and a new expiry that is less than the expiry of the incoming transfer.\nWhen the Payee FSP receives the final incoming transfer to the Payee account, it extracts the ILP Packet and performs the following steps:\n\nValidates that the Payee ILP Address in the ILP Packet corresponds to the Payee account that is the destination of the transfer.\nValidates that the amount in the ILP Packet is the same as the amount of the transfer and directs the local ledger to perform a reservation of the final transfer to the Payee account (less any hidden receiver fees, see Section 5.1).\nIf the reservation is successful, the Payee FSP generates the fulfilment using the same algorithm that was used when generating the condition sent in the callback of the quote (see Section 6.5.1.2).\nThe fulfilment is submitted to the Payee FSP ledger to instruct the ledger to commit the reservation in favor of the Payee. The ledger will validate that the SHA-256 hash of the fulfilment matches the condition attached to the transfer. If it does, it commits the reservation of the transfer. If not, it rejects the transfer and the Payee FSP rejects the payment and cancels the previously-performed reservation.\n\nThe fulfilment is then passed back to the Payer FSP through the same ledgers in the callback of the transfer. As funds are committed on each ledger after a successful validation of the fulfilment, the entity that initiated the transfer will be notified that the funds it reserved have been committed and the fulfilment will be shared as part of that notification message.\nThe final transfer to be committed is the transfer on the Payer FSP's ledger where the reservation is committed from their account. At this point the Payer FSP notifies the Payer of the successful financial transaction.\n6.7.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /transfers.\n6.7.2.1 GET /transfers/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Transfer Information\nThe HTTP request GET /transfers/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested transfer.

For more information regarding a single quote for a transaction, see API Resource /quotes Section 6.5.\nA created bulk quote object contains a quote for each individual transaction in the bulk in a Peer FSP. A bulk quote is irrevocable; it cannot be changed after it has been created However, it can expire (all bulk quotes are valid only until they reach expiration).\nNote: A bulk quote is not a guarantee that the financial transaction will succeed. The bulk transaction can still fail later in the process. A bulk quote only guarantees that the fees and FSP commission involved in performing the specified financial transaction are applicable until the bulk quote expires.\n6.9.1 Service Details\nFigure 58 shows how the bulk quotes process works, using the POST /bulkQuotes service. When receiving the bulk of transactions from the Payer, the Payer FSP should:\n\nLookup the FSP in which each Payee is; for example, using the API Resource /participants, Section 6.2.\n\nDivide the bulk based on Payee FSP. The service POST /bulkQuotes is then used for each Payee FSP to get the bulk quotes from each Payee FSP. Each quote result will contain the ILP Packet and condition (see Section 4.5 and Section 4.4) needed to perform each transfer in the bulk transfer (see API Resource /bulkTransfers, Section 6.10), which will perform the actual financial transaction from the Payer to each Payee.\n\n\nFigure 58\n\nFigure 58 -- Example bulk quote process\n6.9.2 Requests\nThis section describes the services that can be requested by a client in the API on the resource /bulkQuotes.\n6.9.2.1 GET /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Retrieve Bulk Quote Information\nThe HTTP request GET /bulkQuotes/{ID} is used to get information regarding a previously-created or requested bulk quote.\nThe {ID} in the URI should contain the bulkQuoteId (see Table 27) that was used for the creation of the bulk quote.\nCallback and data model information for GET /bulkQuotes/{ID}:\n\nCallback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nError Callback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}/error\nData Model -- Empty body\n\n6.9.2.2 POST /bulkQuotes\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Calculate Bulk Quote\nThe HTTP request POST /bulkQuotes is used to request the creation of a bulk quote for the provided financial transactions on the server.\nCallback and data model information for POST /bulkQuotes:\n\nCallback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nError Callback -- PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}/error\nData Model -- See Table 27\n\nTable 27\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nindividualQuoteResults\n0..1000\nIndividualQuoteResult\nFees for each individual transaction, if any of them are charged per transaction.\n\n\nexpiration\n1\nDateTime\nDate and time until when the quotation is valid and can be honored when used in the subsequent transaction request.\n\n\nextensionList\n0..1\nExtensionList\nOptional extension, specific to deployment.\n\n\n\nTable 27 -- POST /bulkQuotes data model\n6.9.3 Callbacks\nThis section describes the callbacks that are used by the server under the resource /bulkQuotes.\n6.9.3.1 PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID}\nAlternative URI: N/A\nLogical API service: Return Bulk Quote Information\nThe callback PUT /bulkQuotes/{ID} is used to inform the client of a requested or created bulk quote.

For more information about a single transfer, see API Resource /transfers (Section 6.7). Before a bulk transfer can be requested, a bulk quote needs to be performed. See API Resource /bulkQuotes, Section 6.9, for more information.\nA bulk transfer is irrevocable; it cannot be changed, cancelled, or reversed after it has been sent from the Payer FSP.\n6.10.1 Service Details\nFigure 60 shows how the bulk transfer process works, using the POST /bulkTransfers service. When receiving the bulk transactions from the Payer, the Payer FSP should perform the following:\n\nLookup the FSP in which each Payee is; for example, using the API Resource /participants, Section 6.2.\nPerform the bulk quote process using the API Resource /bulkQuotes, Section 6.9. The bulk quote callback should contain the required ILP Packets and conditions needed to perform each transfer.\nPerform bulk transfer process in Figure 60 using POST /bulkTransfers. This performs each hop-to-hop transfer and the end-to-end financial transaction.

API Supporting Data Models\nThis section provides information about additional supporting data models used by the API.\n7.1 Format Introduction\nThis section introduces formats used for element data types used by the API.\nAll element data types have both a minimum and maximum length. The length is indicated by a minimum and maximum length, an exact length, or a regular expression limiting the element in a way that only a specific length or lengths can be used.\n7.1.1 Minimum and Maximum Length\nIf a minimum and maximum length is required, it is indicated after the\ndata type in parentheses, first minimum (inclusive) value, followed by\n\"..\", and then maximum (inclusive) value.\nExamples:\n\nString(1..32) -- String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long\n\nInteger(3..10) -- Integer that is minimum 3 digits, maximum 10 digits long\n\n\n7.1.2 Exact Length\nIf an exact length is used, it is indicated after the data type, in parentheses. One value is allowed only.\nExamples:\n\nString(3) -- String that is exactly three characters long\n\nInteger(4) -- Integer that is exactly 4 digits long\n\n\n7.1.3 Regular Expressions\nSome element data types are restricted using regular expressions. The regular expressions in this document are using the standard for syntax and character classes used in the Perl programming language30.\n7.2 Element Data Type Formats\nThis section defines element data types used by the API.\n7.2.1 String\nThe API data type String is a normal JSON String31, always limited by a minimum and maximum number of characters.\n7.2.1.1 Example Format\nString(1..32) -- A String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long.\n7.2.1.1.1 Example\nAn example of String(1..32) appears below:\nThis String is 28 characters\n7.2.1.2 Example Format\nString(1..128) -- A String that is minimum one character and maximum 128 characters long.\n7.2.1.2.1 Example\nAn example of String(1..128) appears below:\nThis String is longer than 32 characters, but less than 128\n7.2.2 Enum\nThe API data type Enum is a restricted list of allowed JSON String (see Section 7.2.1) values; an enumeration of values. Other values than the ones defined in the list are not allowed.\n7.2.2.1 Example Format\nEnum of String(1..32) -- A String that is minimum one character and maximum 32 characters long and restricted by the allowed list of values. The description of the element contains a link to the enumeration.\n7.2.3 UndefinedEnum\nThe API data type UndefinedEnum is a JSON String consisting of 1 to 32 uppercase characters including an underscore character (_).\n7.2.3.1 Regular Expression**\nThe regular expression for restricting the UndefinedEnum type appears in Listing 13.\nListing 13\n^[A-Z_]{1,32}$\nListing 13 -- Regular expression for data type UndefinedEnum\n7.2.4 Name\nThe API data type Name is a JSON String, restricted by a regular expression to avoid characters that are generally not used in a name.\n7.2.4.1 Regular Expression**\nThe regular expression for restricting the Name type appears in Listing 14. The restriction does not allow a string consisting of whitespace only, all Unicode32 characters are allowed, as well as the period (.) (apostrophe ('), dash (-), comma (,) and space characters ( ). The maximum number of characters in the Name is 128.\nNote: In some programming languages, Unicode support must be specifically enabled. For example, if Java is used the flag UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS must be enabled to allow Unicode characters.\nListing 14\n^(?!\\s*$)[\\w .,'-]{1,128}$\nListing 14 -- Regular expression for data type Name\n7.2.5 Integer\nThe API data type Integer is a JSON String consisting of digits only.

It is also possible to use the PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined by the PartyIdentifier.\n\n\n\n Table 91 -- Enumeration PartyIdType\n7.5.7 PersonalIdentifierType\nTable 92 contains the allowed values for the enumeration PersonalIdentifierType.\nTable 92\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPASSPORT\nA passport number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nNATIONAL_REGISTRATION\nA national registration number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nDRIVING_LICENSE\nA driving license is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nALIEN_REGISTRATION\nAn alien registration number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nNATIONAL_ID_CARD\nA national ID card number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nEMPLOYER_ID\nA tax identification number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nTAX_ID_NUMBER\nA tax identification number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nSENIOR_CITIZENS_CARD\nA senior citizens card number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nMARRIAGE_CERTIFICATE\nA marriage certificate number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nHEALTH_CARD\nA health card number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nVOTERS_ID\nA voterâ€™s identification number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nUNITED_NATIONS\nAn UN (United Nations) number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\nOTHER_ID\nAny other type of identification type number is used in reference to a Party.\n\n\n\nTable 92 -- Enumeration PersonalIdentifierType\n7.5.8 TransactionInitiator\nTable 93 describes valid values for the enumeration TransactionInitiator.\nTable 93\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPAYER\nSender of funds is initiating the transaction.

Figure 62 shows the structure of an error code. The following sections contain information about defined error codes for each high-level error category.\n\nFigure 62 -- Error code structure\nEach defined high- and low-level category combination contains a generic error (x0xx), which can be used if there is no specific error, or if the server would not like to return information which is considered private.\nAll specific errors below xx40; that is, xx00 to xx39, are reserved for future use by the API. All specific errors above and including xx40 can be used for scheme-specific errors. If a client receives an unknown scheme-specific error, the unknown scheme-specific error should be interpreted as a generic error for the high- and low-level category combination instead (xx00).\n7.6.1 Communication Errors -- 1xxx\nAll possible communication or network errors that could arise that cannot be represented by an HTTP status code should use the high-level error code 1 (error codes 1xxx). Because all services in the API are asynchronous, these error codes should generally be used by a Switch in the Callback to the client FSP if the Peer FSP cannot be reached, or when a callback is not received from the Peer FSP within an agreed timeout.\nLow level categories defined under Communication Errors:\n\nGeneric Communication Error -- 10xx\n\nSee Table 99 for all communication errors defined in the API.\nTable 99\n\n\n\nError Code\nName\nDescription\n/participants\n/parties\n/transactionRequests\n/quotes\n/authorizations\n/transfers\n/transactions\n/bulkQuotates\n/bulkTransfers\n\n\n\n\n1000\nCommunication error\nGeneric communication error.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n1001\nDestination communication error\nDestination of the request failed to be reached.

Generic Transaction Patterns Binding\nThis section provides information about how the logical transaction patterns from Generic Transaction Patterns are used in the asynchronous REST binding of the API. Much of the information is provided by way of sequence diagrams. For more information regarding the steps in these diagrams, see Generic Transaction Patterns.\n8.1 Payer Initiated Transaction\nThe Payer Initiated Transaction pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, the pattern should be used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to another Party whom is not located in the same FSP as the Payer. Figure 63 shows the sequence diagram for a Payer Initiated Transaction using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure 63\n\nFigure 63 -- Payer Initiated Transaction pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n8.2 Payee Initiated Transaction\nThe Payee Initiated Transaction pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, the pattern should be used whenever a Payee would like to request that Payer transfer funds to a Payee. The Payer and the Payee are assumed to be in different FSPs, and the approval of the transaction is performed in the Payer FSP. If the transaction information and approval occur on a Payee device instead, use the related Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP pattern described in Section 8.3 instead. Figure 64 shows the sequence diagram for a Payee Initiated Transaction using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure-64\n\nFigure 64 -- Payee Initiated Transaction pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n8.3 Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP\nThe Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, this pattern is like the Payee Initiated Transaction described in Section 8.2; however, in this pattern the transaction information and approval for the Payer is shown and entered on a Payee device instead. As in other transaction patterns, the Payer and the Payee are assumed to be in different FSPs. Figure 65 shows the sequence diagram for a Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure 65\n\nFigure 65 -- Payee Initiated Transaction using OTP pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n8.4 Bulk Transactions\nThe Bulk Transaction pattern is introduced in Generic Transaction Patterns. On a high-level, the pattern is used whenever a Payer would like to transfer funds to multiple Payees using one single transaction. The Payees can be in different FSPs. Figure 66 shows the sequence diagram for a Bulk Transactions using the asynchronous REST binding of the logical version. The process for each number in the sequence diagram is described in Generic Transaction Patterns.\nFigure 66\n\nFigure 66 -- Bulk Transactions pattern using the asynchronous REST binding\n9. API Error Handling\nThis section describes how to handle missing responses or callbacks, as well as how to handle errors in a server during processing of a request.\n9.1 Erroneous Request\nIf a server receives an erroneous service request that can be handled immediately (for example, malformed syntax or resource not found), a valid HTTP client error code (starting with 4xx39) should be returned to the client in the response. The HTTP error codes defined in the API appear in Table 3. The HTTP response may also contain an ErrorInformation element for the purpose of describing the error in more detail (for more information, see Section 3.2.4.1).\n9.2 Error in Server During Processing of Request\nFigure 67 shows an example of how to handle an error on a server during processing.\nFigure 67\n\nFigure 67 -- Error on server during processing of request\n9.2.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list describes the steps in the sequence (see Figure 67).\n\nThe client would like the server to create a new service object and thus uses a POST request.\n\nThe server receives the request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then tries to create the object based on the service request. A processing error occurs, and the request cannot be handled as requested. The server sends the callback PUT /{resource}/{ID}/error including an error code (Section 7.6) and error description to notify the client of the error.\n\nThe client receives the error callback and immediately responds with OK. The client then handles the error.\n\nThe server receives the OK response and the process is completed.\n\n\n9.3 Client Handling on Error Callback\nThe following sections explain how a client handles error callbacks from a server.\n9.3.1 API Resource /participants\nThe typical error from the /participants service is that the requested Party could not be found. The client could either try another server, or notify the end user that the requested Party could not be found.\n9.3.2 API Resource /parties\nThe typical error from the /parties service is that the requested Party could not be found. The client could either try another server, or notify the end user that information regarding the requested Party could not be found.\n9.3.3 API Resource /quotes\nThe typical error from the /quotes service is that a quote could not be calculated for the requested transaction. The client should notify the end user that the requested transaction could not be performed.\n9.3.4 API Resource /transactionRequests\nThe typical error from the /transactionRequests service is that the Payer rejected the transaction or that an automatic validation failed. The client should notify the Payee that the transaction request failed.\n9.3.5 API Resource /authorizations\nThe typical error from the /authorizations service is that the transaction request could not be found. The client should notify the Payer that the transaction request has been cancelled.\n9.3.6 API Resource /transfers\nThe typical error from the /transfers service is that either the hop-to-hop transfer process or the end-to-end financial transaction failed. For example, a limit breach was discovered, or the Payee could not be found. The client (the Payer FSP) should in any error case cancel the reservation for the financial transaction that was performed before requesting the transaction to be performed on the server (the Payee FSP). See Figure 68 for an example including a financial Switch between the FSPs.\nFigure 68\n\nFigure 68 -- Handling of error callback from POST /transfers\n9.3.6.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list provides a detailed description of all the steps in the sequence (see Figure 68).\n\nThe transfer is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request POST /transfers is used on the Switch. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP. The Payer FSP then waits for an accepted response from the Switch.\n\nThe Switch receives the request POST /transfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Payer FSP. The Switch then performs all applicable internal transfer validations. If the validations are successful, a transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfer has been successfully reserved, the request POST /transfers is used on the Payee FSP. The transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. The Switch then waits for an accepted response from the Payee FSP.\n\nThe Payee FSP receives the POST /transfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Switch. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal transaction validations. The validation is assumed to fail at this point, for example, due to a limit breach. The error callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error is used on the Switch to inform the Payer FSP about the error. The Payee FSP then waits for an OK response from the Switch to complete the transfer process.\n\nThe Switch receives the error callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Switch then cancels the earlier reserved transfer, as it has received an error callback. The Switch will then use the callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters, and wait for an OK response to complete the transfer process.\n\nThe Payer FSP receives the callback PUT /transfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Payer FSP then cancels the earlier reserved transfer because it has received an error callback.\n\n\n9.3.7 API Resource /transactions\nThe normal error case from the /transactions service is that the transaction could not be found in the Peer FSP.\n9.3.8 API Resource /bulkQuotes\nThe typical error from the /bulkQuotes service is that a quote could not be calculated for the requested transaction. The client should notify the end user that the requested transaction could not be performed.\n9.3.9 API Resource /bulkTransfers\nThe typical error case from the /bulkTransfers service is that the bulk transaction was not accepted; for example, due to a validation error. The client (the Payer FSP) should in any error case cancel the reservation for the financial transaction that was performed before requesting that the transaction be performed on the server (the Payee FSP). See Figure 69 for an example including a financial Switch between the FSPs.\nFigure 69\n\nFigure 69 -- Handling of error callback from API Service /bulkTransfers\n9.3.9.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list describes the steps in the sequence (see Figure 69).\n\nEach individual transfer in the bulk transfer is reserved from the Payer's account to either a combined Switch account or a Payee FSP account, depending on setup. After each transfer has been successfully reserved, the request POST /bulkTransfers is used on the Switch. The bulk transfer is now irrevocable from the Payer FSP. The Payer FSP then waits for an accepted response from the Switch.\n\nThe Switch receives the request POST /bulkTransfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Payer FSP. The Switch then performs all applicable internal transfer validations. If the validations are successful, each individual transfer is reserved from a Payer FSP account to a Payee FSP account. After the transfers have been successfully reserved, the request POST /bulkTransfers is used on the Payee FSP. The bulk transfer is now irrevocable from the Switch. The Switch then waits for an accepted response from the Payee FSP.\n\nThe Payee FSP receives POST /bulkTransfers and immediately sends an accepted response to the Switch. The Payee FSP then performs all applicable internal bulk transfer validations. The validation is assumed to fail due to some reason; for example, a validation failure that prevents the entire bulk transfer from being performed. The error callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error is used on the Switch to inform the Payer FSP about the error. The Payee FSP then waits for an OK response from the Switch to complete the bulk transfer process.\n\nThe Switch receives the error callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Switch then cancels all the previous reserved transfers, because it has received an error callback. The Switch then uses the callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error to the Payer FSP, using the same parameters, and waits for an OK response to complete the bulk transfer process.\n\nThe Payer FSP receives the callback PUT /bulkTransfers/{ID}/error and immediately responds with an OK response. The Payer FSP then cancels all the earlier reserved transfers, as it has received an error callback.\n\n\n9.4 Client Missing Response from Server - Using Resend of Request\nFigure 70 shows an example UML (Unified Modeling Language) sequence diagram in which a client (FSP or Switch) performs error handling when the client misses a response from a server (Switch or Peer FSP) pertaining to a service request, using resend of the same service request.\nFigure 70\n\nFigure 70 -- Error handling from client using resend of request\n9.4.1 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list provides a detailed description of all the steps in the sequence (see Figure 70).\n\nThe client would like the server to create a new service object. The HTTP request is lost somewhere on the way to the server.\n\nThe client notes that no response has been received from the server within a specified timeout. The client resends the service request.\n\nThe server receives the resent request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then creates the object in accordance with the service request.\n\nThe accepted HTTP response from the server is lost on the way to the client, and the client notes that no response has been received from the server within a specified timeout. The client resends the service request.\n\nThe server receives the resent request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then notes that the service request is the same as in Step 3. As the service request is a resend, the server should not create a new object based on the service request. The server sends a callback to notify the client about the object created in Step 3.\n\nThe client receives the callback regarding the created object. The client sends an OK HTTP response to the server to complete the process.\n\nThe server receives the OK HTTP response from the client, completing the process.\n\n\n9.5 Server Missing Response from Client\nA server using the API is not responsible for making sure that a callback is properly delivered to a client. However, it is considered good practice to retry if the server does not receive an OK response from the client.\n9.5.1 Client Missing Callback - Using GET request\nFigure 71 is a UML sequence diagram showing how a client (Switch or Peer FSP) would perform error handling in case of no callback from a client (FSP or Switch) within a reasonable time.\nFigure 71\n\nFigure 71 -- Error handling from client using GET request\n9.5.2 Internal Processing Steps\nThe following list provides a detailed description of all the steps in the sequence (see Figure 71).\n\nThe client would like the server to create a new service object; a service request is sent.\n\nThe server receives the service request. It immediately sends an accepted response to the client, and then creates the object based on the service request. The object creation is a long running process; for example, a bulk transfer consisting of numerous financial transactions.\n\nThe server notes that no callback has been received from the client within a reasonable time. The client uses a GET service request with the ID that was provided in the original service request.\n\nThe server receives the GET service request. The server sends an accepted HTTP response to the client to notify that the request will be handled.\n\nThe client receives the accepted HTTP response and waits for the callback, which arrives sometime later; the client sends an OK HTTP response and the process is completed.\n\nThe server sends the callback to the client containing the requested information, and an OK HTTP response is received from the client, which completes the process.\n\n\n39 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content -     Client Error 4xx\n10. End-to-End Example\nThis section contains an end-to-end example in which an account holder is provisioned, and then a P2P Transfer from a Payer located in one FSP to a Payee located in another FSP is performed. The example includes both HTTP requests and responses, HTTP headers, and data models in JSON, but without additional security features of using JWS (see Signature) and field level encryption using JWE (see Encryption).\n10.1 Example Setup\nThis section explains the setup of the example.\n10.1.1 Nodes\nFigure 72\nThe nodes in the end-to-end example in this section are simplified by having only two FSPs, where one FSP is a bank (identifier BankNrOne) and the other FSP is a mobile money operator (identifier MobileMoney), and one Switch (identifier Switch). The Switch also acts as the Account Lookup System (ALS) in this simplified setup (see Figure 72).\n\nFigure 72 -- Nodes in end-to-end example\n10.1.2 Account Holders\nThe account holders in the example are:\n\nOne account holder in the FSP BankNrOne named Mats Hagman. Mats Hagman has a bank account with IBAN number SE4550000000058398257466. The currency of the account is USD.\n\nOne account holder in the FSP MobileMoney named Henrik Karlsson. Henrik Karlsson has a mobile money account that is identified by his phone number 123456789. The currency of the account is USD.\n\n\n10.1.3 Scenario\nThe scenario in the example is that Mats Hagman in FSP BankNrOne wants to transfer 100 USD to Henrik Karlsson in the FSP MobileMoney. Before Henrik Karlsson can be found by FSP BankNrOne, Henrik's FSP MobileMoney should provide information to the Switch specifying in which FSP Henrik Karlsson can be found in. The end-to-end flow including all used services can be found in Section 10.1.4.\n10.1.4 Other Notes\nThe JSON messages used in the examples are formatted with color coding, indentations, and line breaks for very long lines to simplify the read of the examples.\nBoth FSPs are assumed to have a pre-funded Switch account in their respective FSPs.\n10.2 End-to-End Flow\nFigure 73 shows the end-to-end flow of the entire example, from provisioning of FSP information to the actual transaction.\nFigure 73\n\nFigure 73 -- End-to-end flow, from provision of account holder FSP information to a successful transaction\n10.3 Provision Account Holder\nBefore the Payee Henrik Karlsson can be found by the Payer FSP BankNrOne, Henrik Karlsson should be provisioned to the ALS, which is also the Switch in this simplified example, by Henrik's FSP (MobileMoney). This is performed through either one of the services POST /participants (bulk version) or POST /participants/{Type}/{ID} (single version). As the Payee in this example is only one (Henrik Karlsson), the single POST /participants/{Type}/{ID} version is used by FSP MobileMoney. The provision could happen anytime, for example when Henrik Karlsson signed up for the financial account, or when the FSP MobileMoney connected to the Switch for the first time.\n10.3.1 FSP MobileMoney Provisions Henrik Karlsson -- Step 1 in End-to-End Flow\nListing 29 shows the HTTP request where the FSP MobileMoney provisions FSP information for account holder Henrik Karlsson, identified by MSISDN and 123456789 (see Section 5.2 for more information about Party Addressing). The JSON element fspId is set to the FSP identifier (MobileMoney), and JSON element currency is set to the currency of the account (USD).\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request,\nand Section 6.2.2.3 for more information about the service POST /participants/{Type}/{ID}. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5. Information about API version negotiation can be found in Section 3.3.4.\nListing 29\nPOST /participants/MSISDN/123456789 HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.interoperability.participants+json;version=1\nContent-Length: 50\nContent-Type:\napplication/vnd.interoperability.participants+json;version=1.0\nDate: Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:12:31 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: Switch\n{\n    \"fspId\": \"MobileMoney\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\"\n}\nListing 29 -- Provision FSP information for account holder Henrik Karlsson\nListing 30 shows the asynchronous HTTP response where the Switch immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the HTTP request in Listing 29.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 30\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nContent-Type:\napplication/vnd.interoperability.participants+json;version=1.0\nListing 30 -- Asynchronous response on provision request\n10.3.2 Switch Handles Provision -- Step 2 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the Switch has received the HTTP request in Listing 29 and sent the asynchronous response in Listing 30, the Switch should verify the body of the request in Listing 29. An example verification is to check that the fspId element is the same as the FSPIOP-Source , as it should be the FSP of the account holder who provisions the information. A scheme could also have restrictions on which currencies are allowed, which means that the Switch should then check that the currency in the currency element is allowed.\nAfter the Switch has verified the request correctly, the information that the account holder identified by MSISDN and 123456789 is located in FSP MobileMoney should be stored in the Switch's database.\n10.3.3 Switch Sends Successful Callback -- Step 3 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the Switch has successfully stored the information that the account holder identified by MSISDN and 123456789 is located in FSP MobileMoney, the Switch must send a callback using the service PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID} to notify the FSP MobileMoney about the outcome of the request in Listing 29. Listing 31 shows the HTTP request for the callback.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request. In the callback, the Accept header should not be used as this is a callback to an earlier requested service. The HTTP headers FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are now inverted compared to the HTTP request in Listing 29, as detailed in Section 3.2.3.5. See Section 6.2.3.1 for more information about the callback [PUT /participants/{Type}/{ID}](#6231-put-participantstypeid.\nListing 31\nPUT /participants/MSISDN/123456789 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Length: 50\nContent-Type:\nDate: Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:12:32 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: Switch\n{\n    \"fspId\": \"MobileMoney\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\"\n}\nListing 31 -- Callback for the earlier requested provision service\nListing 32 shows the asynchronous HTTP response where the FSP MobileMoney immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the completion of the process, after receiving the callback in Listing 31.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 32\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type:\napplication/vnd.interoperability.participants+json;version=1.0\nListing 32 -- Asynchronous response for the callback\n10.4 P2P Transfer\nAs the intended Payee Henrik Karlsson is now known by the Switch (which is also the ALS) as detailed in Section 10.3, Mats Hagman can now initiate and approve the use case P2P Transfer from his bank to Henrik Karlsson.\n10.4.1 Initiate Use Case -- Step 4 in End-to-End Flow\nMats Hagman knows that Henrik Karlsson has phone number 123456789, so he inputs that number on his device as recipient and 100 USD as amount. The actual communication between Mats' device and his bank BankNrOne is out of scope for this API.\n10.4.2 Request Party Information from Switch -- Step 5 in End-to-End Flow\nIn Step 5 in the end-to-end flow, BankNrOne receives the request from Mats Hagman that he would like the phone number 123456789 to receive 100 USD. BankNrOne performs an internal search to see if 123456789 exists within the bank, but fails to find the account internally. BankNrOne then uses the service GET /parties/{Type}/{ID} in the Switch to see if the Switch knows anything about the account.\nListing 33 shows the HTTP request where the FSP BankNrOne asks the Switch for Party information regarding the account identified by MSISDN and 123456789.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.3.2.1 for more information about the service GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5 in this request, the FSP BankNrOne does not know in which FSP the other account holder resides. Thus, the FSPIOP-Destination is not present. Information about API version negotiation can be found in Section 3.3.4.\nListing 33\nGET /parties/MSISDN/123456789 HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1.0\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2017 10:13:37 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: BankNrOne\nListing 33 -- Get Party information for account identified by MSISDN and 123456789 from FSP BankNrOne\nListing 34 shows the asynchronous HTTP response where the Switch immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the HTTP request in Listing 33.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 34\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1.0\nListing 34 -- Asynchronous response on the request for Party information\n10.4.3 Request Party Information from FSP -- Step 6 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the Switch has received the HTTP request in Listing 33 and sent the asynchronous response in Listing 34, the Switch can proceed with checking its database if it has information regarding in which FSP the account holder identified by MSISDN and 123456789 is located. As that information was provisioned as detailed in Section 10.3, the Switch knows that the account is in FSP MobileMoney. Therefore, the Switch sends the HTTP request in Listing 35.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.3.2.1 for more information about the service GET /parties/{Type}/{ID}. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5; in this request the Switch has added the header FSPIOP-Destination because the Switch knew to where the request should be routed. Information about API version negotiation can be found in Section 3.3.4.\nListing 35\nGET /parties/MSISDN/123456789 HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1.0\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2017 10:13:38 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: BankNrOne\nFSPIOP-Destination: MobileMoney\nListing 35 -- Get Party information for account identified by MSISDN and 123456789 from Switch\nListing 36 shows the asynchronous HTTP response where the FSP MobileMoney immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the HTTP request in Listing 35.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 36\nHTTP/1.1 202 Accepted\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1.0\nListing 36 -- Asynchronous response on request for Party information\n10.4.4 Lookup Party Information in FSP MobileMoney -- Step 7 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the FSP MobileMoney has received the HTTP request in Listing 35 and sent the asynchronous response in Listing 36, the FSP MobileMoney can proceed with checking its database for more information regarding the account identified by MSISDN and 123456789. As the account exists and is owned by Henrik Karlsson, the FSP MobileMoney sends the callback in Listing 37. The FSP MobileMoney does not want to share some details, for example birth date, with the other FSP (BankNrOne), so some optional elements are not sent.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request,\nand Section 6.3.3.1 for more information about the callback PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}. In the callback, the Accept header should not be sent. The HTTP headers FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are now inverted compared to the HTTP request in Listing 35, as detailed in Section 3.2.3.5.\nListing 37\nPUT /parties/MSISDN/123456789 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1.0\nContent-Length: 347\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2017 10:13:39 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: BankNrOne\n{\n    \"party\": {\n        \"partyIdInfo\": {\n            \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\",\n            \"partyIdentifier\": \"123456789\",\n            \"fspId\": \"MobileMoney\"\n        },\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": {\n                \"firstName\": \"Henrik\",\n                \"lastName\": \"Karlsson\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nListing 37 -- Callback to the request for Party information\nListing 38 shows the asynchronous HTTP response where the Switch immediately (after basic verification of for example required headers) acknowledges the completion of the process, after receiving the callback in Listing 37.\nSee Table 2 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP response.\nListing 38\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.parties+json;version=1.0\nListing 38 -- Asynchronous response for the Party information callback\n10.4.5 Send Callback to FSP BankNrOne -- Step 8 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen the Switch has received the callback in Listing 37 and sent the asynchronous response in Listing 38, it should relay the exact same callback as in Listing 37 to the FSP BankNrOne, and BankNrOne should then respond asynchronously with the exact same response as in Listing 38.\nThe HTTP request and response are not repeated in this section, as they are the same as in the last section, but sent from the Switch to BankNrOne (HTTP request in Listing 37) and from BankNrOne to the Switch (HTTP response in Listing 38) instead.\n10.4.6 Send Quote Request from FSP BankNrOne -- Step 9 in End-to-End Flow\nAfter receiving Party information in the callback PUT /parties/{Type}/{ID}, the FSP BankNrOne now knows that the account identified by MSISDN and 123456789 exists and that it is in the FSP MobileMoney. It also knows the name of the account holder. Depending on implementation, the name of the intended Payee (Henrik Karlsson) could be shown to Mats Hagman already in this step before sending the quote. In this example, a quote request is sent before showing the name and any fees.\nThe FSP BankNrOne sends the HTTP request in Listing 39 to request the quote. BankNrOne does not want to disclose its fees (see Section 5.1 for more information about quoting), which means that it does not include the fees element in the request. The amountType element is set to RECEIVE as Mats wants Henrik to receive 100 USD. The transactionType is set according to Section 5.3. Information about Mats is sent in the payer element. BankNrOne has also generated two UUIDs for the quote ID (7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6) and the transaction ID (85feac2f-39b2-491b-817e-4a03203d4f14). These IDs must be unique, as described in Section 3.1.1.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.5.2.2 for more information about the service POST /quotes. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5.

Since the Payee Henrik Karlsson should receive 100 USD and the FSP commission is determined to 1 USD, the FSP BankNrOne only needs to transfer 99 USD to the FSP MobileMoney (see Section 5.1.1.1 for the equation). The 99 USD is entered in the transferAmount element in the callback, which is the amount that should later be transferred between the FSPs.\nTo send the callback, the FSP MobileMoney then needs to create an ILP Packet (see Section 4.5 for more information) that is base64url-encoded, as the ilpPacket element in the PUT /quotes/{ID} callback is defined as a BinaryString (see Section 7.2.17). How to populate the ILP Packet is explained in Section 6.5.1.2. Henrik's ILP address in the FSP MobileMoney has been set to g.se.mobilemoney.msisdn.123456789 (see Section 4.3 for more information about ILP addressing). As the transfer amount is 99 USD and the currency USD's exponent is 2, the amount to be populated in the ILP Packet is 9900 (99 * 10\\^2 = 9900). The remaining element in the ILP Packet is the data element. As described in Section 6.5.1.2, this element should contain the Transaction data model (see Section 7.4.17). With the information from the quote request, the Transaction in this example becomes as shown in Listing 41. Base64url-encoding the entire ILP Packet with the amount, account, and the data element then results in the ilpPacket element in the PUT /quotes/{ID} callback.\nWhen the ILP Packet has been created, the fulfilment and the condition can be generated as defined in the algorithm in Listing 12. Using a generated example secret shown in Listing 42 (shown as base64url-encoded), the fulfilment becomes as in Listing 43 (shown as base64url-encoded) after executing the HMAC SHA-256 algorithm on the ILP Packet using the generated secret as key. The FSP MobileMoney is assumed to save the fulfilment in the database, so that it does not have to be regenerated later. The condition is then the result of executing the SHA-256 hash algorithm on the fulfilment, which becomes as in Listing 44 (shown as base64url-encoded).\nThe complete callback to the quote request becomes as shown in Listing 45.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.5.3.1 for more information about the callback PUT /quotes/{ID}. The {ID} in the URI should be taken from the quote ID in the quote request, which in the example is 7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6. In the callback, the Accept header should not be sent. The HTTP headers FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source are now inverted compared to the HTTP request in Listing 39, as detailed in Section 3.2.3.5.\nListing 41\n{\n    \"transactionId\": \"85feac2f-39b2-491b-817e-4a03203d4f14\",\n    \"quoteId\": \"7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6\",\n    \"payee\": {\n        \"partyIdInfo\": {\n            \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\",\n            \"partyIdentifier\": \"123456789\",\n            \"fspId\": \"MobileMoney\"\n        },\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": {\n                \"firstName\": \"Henrik\",\n                \"lastName\": \"Karlsson\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"payer\": {\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": {\n                \"firstName\": \"Mats\",\n                \"lastName\": \"Hagman\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"partyIdInfo\": {\n            \"partyIdType\": \"IBAN\",\n            \"partyIdentifier\": \"SE4550000000058398257466\",\n            \"fspId\": \"BankNrOne\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"amount\": {\n        \"amount\": \"99\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    },\n    \"transactionType\": {\n        \"scenario\": \"TRANSFER\",\n        \"initiator\": \"PAYER\",\n        \"initiatorType\": \"CONSUMER\"\n    },\n    \"note\": \"From Mats\"\n}\nListing 41 -- The Transaction JSON object\nListing 42\nJdtBrN2tskq9fuFr6Kg6kdy8RANoZv6BqR9nSk3rUbY\nListing 42 -- Generated secret, encoded in base64url\nListing 43\nmhPUT9ZAwd-BXLfeSd7-YPh46rBWRNBiTCSWjpku90s\nListing 43 -- Calculated fulfilment from the ILP Packet and secret, encoded in base64url\nListing 44\nfH9pAYDQbmoZLPbvv3CSW2RfjU4jvM4ApG\\_fqGnR7Xs\nListing 44 -- Calculated condition from the fulfilment, encoded in base64url\nListing 45\nPUT /quotes/7c23e80c-d078-4077-8263-2c047876fcf6 HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/vnd.interoperability.quotes+json;version=1.0\nContent-Length: 1802\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2017 10:13:41 GMT\nFSPIOP-Source: MobileMoney\nFSPIOP-Destination: BankNrOne\n{\n    \"transferAmount\": {\n        \"amount\": \"99\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    },\n    \"payeeReceiveAmount\": {\n        \"amount\": \"100\",\n        \"currency\": \"USD\"\n    },\n    \"expiration\": \"2017-11-15T14:17:09.663+01:00\",\n    \"ilpPacket\": \"AQAAAAAAACasIWcuc2UubW9iaWxlbW9uZXkubXNpc2RuLjEyMzQ1Njc4OY-\nIEIXsNCiAgICAidHJhbnNhY3Rpb25JZCI6ICI4NWZlY-\nWMyZi0zOWIyLTQ5MWItODE3ZS00YTAzMjAzZDRmMTQiLA0KICAgICJxdW90ZUlkIjogIjdjMjNlOD-\nBjLWQwNzgtNDA3Ny04MjYzLTJjMDQ3ODc2ZmNmNiIsDQogICAgInBheWVlIjogew0KICAgICAgI-\nCAicGFydHlJZEluZm8iOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAicGFydHlJZFR5cGUiOiAiTVNJU0ROIiwNCiAgI-\nCAgICAgICAgICJwYXJ0eUlkZW50aWZpZXIiOiAiMTIzNDU2Nzg5IiwNCiAgICAgICAgI-\nCAgICJmc3BJZCI6ICJNb2JpbGVNb25leSINCiAgICAgICAgfSwNCiAgICAgI-\nCAgInBlcnNvbmFsSW5mbyI6IHsNCiAgICAgICAgICAgICJjb21wbGV4TmFtZSI6IHsNCiAgICAgICAgI-\nCAgICAgICAiZmlyc3ROYW1lIjogIkhlbnJpayIsDQogICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgImxhc3ROYW1lIjogIk-\nthcmxzc29uIg0KICAgICAgICAgICAgfQ0KICAgICAgICB9DQogICAgfSwNCiAgICAicGF5ZXIi-\nOiB7DQogICAgICAgICJwZXJzb25hbEluZm8iOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAiY29tcGxleE5hbWUi-\nOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAgICAgImZpcnN0TmFtZSI6ICJNYXRzIiwNCiAgICAgICAgICAgICAgI-\nCAibGFzdE5hbWUiOiAiSGFnbWFuIg0KICAgICAgICAgICAgfQ0KICAgICAgICB9LA0KICAgICAgI-\nCAicGFydHlJZEluZm8iOiB7DQogICAgICAgICAgICAicGFydHlJZFR5cGUiOiAiSUJBTiIsDQogICAgI-\nCAgICAgICAicGFydHlJZGVudGlmaWVyI-\njogIlNFNDU1MDAwMDAwMDA1ODM5ODI1NzQ2NiIsDQogICAgICAgICAgICAiZnNwSWQiOiAiQmFua05yT25\nlIg0KICAgICAgICB9DQogICAgfSwNCiAgICAiYW1vdW50Ijogew0KICAgICAgICAiYW1vdW50IjogIjEw-\nMCIsDQogICAgICAgICJjdXJyZW5jeSI6ICJVU0QiDQogICAgfSwNCiAgICAidHJhbnNhY3Rpb25UeXBlI-\njogew0KICAgICAgICAic2NlbmFyaW8iOiAiVFJBTlNGRVIiLA0KICAgICAgICAiaW5pdGlhdG9yI-\njogIlBBWUVSIiwNCiAgICAgICAgImluaXRpYXRvclR5cGUiOiAiQ09OU1VNRVIiDQogICAgfSwNCiAgI-\nCAibm90ZSI6ICJGcm9tIE1hdHMiDQp9DQo\\u003d\\u003d\",\n    \"condition\": \"fH9pAYDQbmoZLPbvv3CSW2RfjU4jvM4ApG_fqGnR7Xs\"\n}\nListing 45 -- Quote callback\nNote: The element ilpPacket in Listing 45 should be on a single line in a real implementation;

In this example, the fee for the Payer is set to 0 USD, but the FSP commission from the FSP MobileMoney is kept as an income for the FSP BankNrOne. This means that for the Payee Henrik Karlsson to receive 100 USD, the Payer Mats Hagman must transfer 100 USD from his account. 99 USD will then be transferred between the FSPs BankNrOne and MobileMoney.\nThe FSP BankNrOne then notifies Mats Hagman that the transaction to transfer 100 USD to Henrik Karlsson will cost 0 USD in fees. How Mats Hagman is notified is out of scope of this API.\n10.4.11 Payer Accepts Transaction -- Step 14 in End-to-End Flow\nIn this example, Mats Hagman accepts to perform the transaction. How the acceptance is sent is outside the scope of this API.\n10.4.12 Send Transfer Request from FSP BankNrOne -- Step 15 in End-to-End Flow\nWhen Mats Hagman has accepted the transaction, FSP BankNrOne reserves the internal transfers needed to perform the transaction. This means that 100 USD will be reserved from Mats Hagman's account, where 1 USD will end up as income for the FSP and 99 USD will be transferred to the prefunded Switch account. After the reservations are successfully performed, the FSP BankNrOne sends a POST /transfers to the Switch as in Listing 47. The same ilpPacket and condition elements are sent as was received in the quote callback and the amount is the same as the received transferAmount, see Listing 45.\nSee Table 1 for the required HTTP headers in a HTTP request, and Section 6.7.2.2 for more information about the service POST /transfers. More information regarding routing of requests using FSPIOP-Destination and FSPIOP-Source can be found in Section 3.2.3.5.

Introduction\nThis document details security methods to be implemented for Open API (Application Programming Interface) for FSP (Financial Service Provider) Interoperability (hereafter cited as \"the API\") to ensure confidentiality of API messages between an API client and the API\nserver.\nIn information security, confidentiality means that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes (excerpt from ISO27000The ISO 27000 Directory). For the API, confidentiality means that some sensitive fields in the payload of an API message cannot be accessed or identified in an unauthorized or undetected manner by the intermediaries involved in the API communication. That is, if some fields of an API message are encrypted by the API client, then only the expected API recipient can decrypt those fields.\nJSON Web Encryption (JWE, defined in RFC 7516JSON Web Encryption (JWE)) must be applied to the API to provide end to end message confidentiality. When an API client sends an HTTP request (such as an API request or callback message) to a counterparty, the API client can determine whether there are sensitive fields in the API message to be protected according to the regulation or local schema. If there is a field to be protected, then the API client uses JWE to encrypt the value of that field. Subsequently, the cipher text of that field will be transmitted to the counterparty.\nTo support encryption for multiple fields of an API message, JWE is extended in this document to adapt to the requirements of the API.\n2.1 Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification\nThe Open API for FSP Interoperability Specification includes the following documents.\n2.1.1 General Documents\n\nGlossary\n\n2.1.2 Logical Documents\n\nLogical Data Model\n\nGeneric Transaction Patterns\n\nUse Cases\n\n\n2.1.3 Asynchronous REST Binding Documents\n\nAPI Definition\n\nJSON Binding Rules\n\nScheme Rules\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Integrity, Confidentiality, and Non-Repudiation\n\nPKI Best Practices\n\nSignature\n\nEncryption\n\n\n3. API Encryption Definition\nThis section introduces the technology used by API encryption, including:\n\nData exchange format for the encrypted fields of an API message.\n\nMechanism for encrypting and decrypting fields.\n\n\n3.1 Encryption Data Model\nThe API uses the customized HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption to represent the encrypted fields of an API message; its value is a JSON object serialization. The data model of this parameter is described in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3.\nNote: If FSPIOP-Encryption is present in an API message, then it must also be protected by the API signature. That means FSPIOP-Encryption must be included in the JWS Protected Header of the signature.\nTable 1\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nencryptedFields\n1\nEncryptedFields\nInformation about the encrypted fields of an API message\n\n\n\nTable 1 -- Data model of HTTP Header Field FSPIOP-Encryption\nTable 2\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nencryptedField\n1..*\nEncryptedField\nInformation about the encrypted field of an API message\n\n\n\nTable 2 -- Data model of complex type EncryptedFields\nTable 3\n\n\n\nName\nCardinality\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfieldName\n1\nString(1..512)\nThis element identifies the field to be encrypted in the payload of an API message. Because the API payload is a JSON Object serialization string, the field name must be able to identify the exact element path in the JSON Object. A single period ('.') character is used to separate the elements in an element path. For example, payer.personalInfo.dateOfBirth is a valid value for this element for the API request POST /quotes.\n\n\nencryptedKey\n1\nString(1..512)\nEncrypted Content Encryption Key (CEK) value. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key). If there are multiple fields of the API message to be encrypted, we recommend that the same JWE Encrypted Key be used to simplify the implementation; however, this is a decision to be made by each FSP internally based on their implementation.\n\n\nprotectedHeader\n1\nString(1..1024)\nThis element identifies the Header Parameters that are applied to JWE to encrypt the specified field. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)). For example, if the JWE Protected Header applied to the encryption is {\"alg\":\"RSA-OAEP- 256\",\"enc\":\"A256GCM\"}, then the value is eyJhbGciOiJSU0EtT0FFUCIsImVuYyI6IkEyNTZHQ00ifQ.\n\n\ninitializationVector\n1\nString(1..128)\nInitialization Vector value used when encrypting the plaintext. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector).\n\n\nauthenticationTag\n1\nString(1..128)\nAuthentication Tag value resulting from authenticated encryption of the plaintext with Additional Authenticated Data. Its value is encoded by BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag)\n\n\n\nTable 3 -- Data model of complex type EncryptedField\n3.2 Encrypt Fields of API Message\nThis section describes the encryption process for message fields. The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps.\n\nDetermine the algorithm used to determine the CEK value (this is the algorithm recorded in the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter of the resulting JWE). Because the CEK should be encrypted with the public key of the API recipient, in the API the available algorithms to protect the CEK can only be RSA-OAEP-256. \nIf there are multiple fields to be encrypted in the API message, then perform Steps 3-15 for each field. \nGenerate a random CEK. The FSP can generate the value using either its own application or using the JWE implementation employed. \nEncrypt the CEK with the algorithm determined by the JWE header parameter alg. \nCompute the encoded key value BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key). \nGenerate a random JWE Initialization Vector of the correct size for the content encryption algorithm (if required for the algorithm); otherwise, let the JWE Initialization Vector be the empty octet sequence. \nCompute the encoded Initialization Vector value BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector). \nIf a zip parameter was included, compress the plaintext using the specified compression algorithm and let M be the octet sequence representing the compressed plain text; otherwise, let M be the octet sequence representing the plain text. \nCreate the JSON object or objects containing the desired set of header parameters, which together comprise the JWE Protected Header. Besides the parameter alg, the parameter enc must be included in the JWE Protected Header. The available values for the parameter enc in the API can only be: A128GCM, A192GCM, A256GCM. A256GCM is recommended. \nCompute the Encoded Protected Header value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected Header)). \nLet the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header). \nEncrypt M using the CEK, the JWE Initialization Vector, and the Additional Authenticated Data value using the specified content encryption algorithm to create the JWE Cipher text value and the JWE Authentication Tag (which is the Authentication Tag output from the encryption operation). \nCompute the encoded cipher text value BASE64URL(JWE Cipher Text). \nCompute the encoded Authentication Tag value BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag). \nCompute the encryptedField element (see Table 3) for the HTTP header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption. \nCompute the value for the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption as described in Section 2.1. The value for this FSPIOP-Encryption is JSON Object Serialization string.\n\nNote: If JWE is used to encrypt some fields of the payload, then the API client should:\n\nEncrypt the desired fields.\n\nReplace those fields' value with the encoded cipher text in the payload.\n\nSign the payload.\n\n\n3.3 Decrypt Fields of API Message\nIf the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption (which is also protected by the API signature) is present, then the API message recipient should decrypt the encrypted fields of the API message after the API signature is validated successfully. The message decryption process is the reverse of the encryption process. The order of the steps is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the steps. If there are multiple fields being encrypted, then all fields must be decrypted successfully; otherwise it indicates the API message is invalid.\n\nParse the HTTP Header parameter FSPIOP-Encryption to get encrypted fields' information, including field name, JWE Protected Header, JWE Encrypted Key, JWE Initialization Vector, and JWE Authentication Tag for each field. If there are multiple fields being encrypted, then perform Steps 2-9 for each encrypted field.\nGet the cipher text of the encrypted field by parsing the payload with the specified field path. The value of the specified field is already encoded with BASE64URL. \nVerify that the octet sequence resulting from decoding the encoded JWE Protected Header is a UTF-8-encoded representation of a valid JSON object conforming to JSON Data Interchange Format (defined in RFC 7159The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format); let the JWE Protected Header be this JSON object. \nVerify that the parameters in the JWE Protected Header understand and can process all fields that are required to support the JWE specification; for example, the algorithm being used.\nDetermine that the algorithm specified by the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter matches the algorithm of the public / private key of the API recipient. \nDecrypt the JWE Encrypted Key with the private key of the API recipient to get the JWE CEK. \nLet the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header). \nDecrypt the JWE Cipher Text using the CEK, the JWE Initialization Vector, the Additional Authenticated Data value, and the JWE Authentication Tag (which is the Authentication Tag input to the calculation) using the specified content encryption algorithm, returning the decrypted plaintext and validating the JWE Authentication Tag in the manner specified for the algorithm. If the JWE Authentication Tag is incorrect, then reject the input without any decryption. \nIf a zip parameter was included, then the API recipient should decompress the decrypted plaintext using the specified compression algorithm. \n\n4. API Encryption/Decryption Examples\nThis section uses a typical quote process to explain how the API encryption and decryption are implemented using JWE. As the algorithm of public / private key of the API recipient can only be RSA, the RSA key used for this example is represented in JSON Web Key (JWK, defined in RFC 7517JSON Web Key(JWK)) format below (with line breaks and indentation within values for display purposes only):\n{\n    \"kty\": \"RSA\",\n    \"n\": \"oahUIoWw0K0usKNuOR6H4wkf4oBUXHTxRvgb48E-\n        BVvxkeDNjbC4he8rUWcJoZmds2h7M70imEVhRU5djINXtqllXI4DFqcI1DgjT9Le\n        wND8MW2Krf3Spsk_ZkoFnilakGygTwpZ3uesH-\n        PFABNIUYpOiN15dsQRkgr0vEhxN92i2asbOenSZeyaxziK72UwxrrKoExv6kc5tw\n        XTq4h-QChLOln0_mtUZwfsRaMStPs6mS6XrgxnxbWhojf663tuEQueGC-\n        FCMfra36C9knDFGzKsNa7LZK2djYgyD3JR_MB_4NUJW_TqOQtwHYbxevoJArm-\n        L5StowjzGy-_bq6Gw\",\n    \"e\": \"AQAB\",\n    \"d\": \"kLdtIj6GbDks_ApCSTYQtelcNttlKiOyPzMrXHeI-yk1F7-kpDxY4-\n        WY5NWV5KntaEeXS1j82E375xxhWMHXyvjYecPT9fpwR_M9gV8n9Hrh2anTpTD93D\n        t62ypW3yDsJzBnTnrYu1iwWRgBKrEYY46qAZIrA2xAwnm2X7uGR1hghkqDp0Vqj3\n        kbSCz1XyfCs6_LehBwtxHIyh8Ripy40p24moOAbgxVw3rxT_vlt3UVe4WO3JkJOz\n        lpUf-KTVI2Ptgm-dARxTEtE-id-4OJr0h-K-\n        VFs3VSndVTIznSxfyrj8ILL6MG_Uv8YAu7VILSB3lOW085-4qE3DzgrTjgyQ\",\n    \"p\": \"1r52Xk46c-LsfB5P442p7atdPUrxQSy4mti_tZI3Mgf2EuFVbUoDBvaRQ-\n        SWxkbk-\n        moEzL7JXroSBjSrK3YIQgYdMgyAEPTPjXv_hI2_1eTSPVZfzL0lffNn03IXqWF5M\n        DFuoUYE0hzb2vhrlN_rKrbfDIwUbTrjjgieRbwC6Cl0\",\n    \"q\":\n        \"wLb35x7hmQWZsWJmB_vle87ihgZ19S8lBEROLIsZG4ayZVe9Hi9gDVCOBmUDdaD\n        YVTSNx_8Fyw1YYa9XGrGnDew00J28cRUoeBB_jKI1oma0Orv1T9aXIWxKwd4gvxF\n        ImOWr3QRL9KEBRzk2RatUBnmDZJTIAfwTs0g68UZHvtc\",\n    \"dp\": \"ZK-\n        YwE7diUh0qR1tR7w8WHtolDx3MZ_OTowiFvgfeQ3SiresXjm9gZ5KLhMXvo-uz-\n        KUJWDxS5pFQ_M0evdo1dKiRTjVw_x4NyqyXPM5nULPkcpU827rnpZzAJKpdhWAgq\n        rXGKAECQH0Xt4taznjnd_zVpAmZZq60WPMBMfKcuE\",\n    \"dq\":\n        \"Dq0gfgJ1DdFGXiLvQEZnuKEN0UUmsJBxkjydc3j4ZYdBiMRAy86x0vHCjywcMlY\n        Yg4yoC4YZa9hNVcsjqA3FeiL19rk8g6Qn29Tt0cj8qqyFpz9vNDBUfCAiJVeESOj\n        JDZPYHdHY8v1b-o-Z2X5tvLx-TCekf7oxyeKDUqKWjis\",\n    \"qi\": \"VIMpMYbPf47dT1w_zDUXfPimsSegnMOA1zTaX7aGk_8urY6R8-\n        ZW1FxU7AlWAyLWybqq6t16VFd7hQd0y6flUK4SlOydB61gwanOsXGOAOv82cHq0E\n        3eL4HrtZkUuKvnPrMnsUUFlfUdybVzxyjz9JF_XyaY14ardLSjf4L_FNY\"\n}\n\n4.1 Encryption Example\nThe following message text is an example of POST /quotes without encryption sent by Payer FSP to a Payee FSP.\nPOST /quotes HTTP/1.1 \nFSPIOP-Destination:5678\nAccept:application/vnd.interoperability.quotes+json;version=1.0 \nContent-Length:975 \nDate:Tue, 23 May 2017 21:12:31 GMT \nFSPIOP-Source:1234 \nContent-Type:application/vnd.interoperability.quotes+json;version=1.0\n\n{\n    \"payee\": {\n        \"partyIdInfo\": { \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\", \"partyIdentifier\": \"15295558888\",\n            \"fspId\": \"5678\" } },\n    \"amountType\": \"RECEIVE\",\n    \"transactionType\": { \"scenario\": \"TRANSFER\", \"initiator\": \"PAYER\",\n        \"subScenario\": \"P2P Transfer across MM systems\", \"initiatorType\": \"CONSUMER\" },\n    \"note\": \"this is a sample for POST /quotes\",\n    \"amount\": { \"amount\": \"150\",\"currency\": \"USD\" },\n    \"fees\": { \"amount\": \"1.5\", \"currency\": \"USD\" },\n    \"extensionList\": [\n        { \"value\": \"value1\", \"key\": \"key1\"},\n        { \"value\": \"value2\", \"key\": \"key2\"},\n        { \"value\": \"value3\", \"key\": \"key3\" }\n    ],\n    \"geoCode\": { \"latitude\": \"57.323889\", \"longitude\": \"125.520001\"\n    },\n    \"expiration\": \"2017-05-24T08:40:00.000-04:00\",\n    \"payer\": {\n        \"personalInfo\": {\n            \"complexName\": { \"firstName\": \"Bill\", \"middleName\": \"Ben\", \"LastName\": \"Lee\"\n            }, \"dateOfBirth\": \"1986-02-14\" },\n        \"partyIdInfo\": { \"partyIdType\": \"MSISDN\",\n            \"partySubIdOrType\": \"RegisteredCustomer\", \"partyIdentifier\": \"16135551212\",\n            \"fspId\": \"1234\"\n        }, \"name\": \"Bill Lee\"\n    }, \"quoteId\": \"59e331fa-345f-4554-aac8-fcd8833f7d50\",\n    \"transactionId\": \"36629a51-393a-4e3c-b347-c2cb57e1e1fc\"\n}\n\nIn this case, the Payer FSP would like to encrypt two fields of the API message: payer and payee.partyIdInfo.partyIdentifier.\n4.1.1 Encrypt the Required Fields\nBecause there are two fields to be encrypted, the Payer FSP needs to encrypt the two fields one-by-one.\n4.1.1.1 Encrypt \"payer\"\nThe Payer FSP performs the following steps to encrypt the field payer in the POST /quotes API message.\n\nDetermine the algorithm used to determine the CEK value.
